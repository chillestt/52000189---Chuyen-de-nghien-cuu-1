Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nI think students should study about food in schools more frequently. Some people think there is not so much to learn about food, but I think that is wrong. There are lots of different way of preparing food, and it takes lots of time to master them. Also, science behind food is very complex, but it is significant in our life. I will demonstrate my opinion in detail in this essay.\nFirst of all, food is a critical part of a life. In many culture, having and preparing food is considered one of the most important activities to live a enjoyable life. By having a delicious food, one can feel happiness uncomparable to anything. Moreover, preparing food for someone like family or lover is a tremendously rewarding activity. By preparing food for them, you can show how much you care about them, and share your emotions with them. To enjoy this amazing part of life, it is very important to learn how to prepare food and what makes delicious food.\nSecondly, It is crucial to know about how the food effect their health. Some people say 'A human body is a sum of what they have eaten in their life', because The food they ate become a part of their body in the end. We get most of nutritions we need from food. Thus, how we eat massively affect our health. It is scientifically proven that the food culture of a country significantly effect the health status of the people. Therfore, knowing about how the nutritions in food affect our body is very important to leave a healthy life.\nFor this reason, it is crucial to teach about food to students in schools. Food can be a means of communication sometimes, and it can be a precious present that is given to a life. Moreover, food is a source of energy that sustain us, and sometimes it is a medicine that cure our body. Hence, students should study about how to prepare a good food, and understand how it can affect us by its nutritions.\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Re-evaluation of the essay based on the criteria of IELTS writing:\n\n1.

"," ""Overall, this essay addresses the prompt by discussing both views and presenting a clear opinion. However, there are several areas for improvement.\n\nTask Achievement:\nThe essay adequately discusses both views - that students should study the science of food and how to prepare it, and that school time should be used in learning important subjects. The writer clearly expresses their opinion and provides reasons to support it. Therefore, the essay demonstrates a satisfactory level of task achievement.\n\nCoherence and Cohesion:\nThe essay lacks proper organization and coherence. The ideas are presented in a somewhat disorganized manner, without clear topic sentences or transitions between paragraphs. This makes it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. Additionally, the essay is quite short and could benefit from further development and expansion of ideas.\n\nLexical Resource:\nThe writer demonstrates a fair range of vocabulary, although there are some errors and repetitive use of certain words. The essay would benefit from a wider variety of vocabulary to enhance the overall quality of the writing.\n\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy:\nThere are several grammatical errors throughout the essay, including mistakes in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, and word order. These errors hinder the clarity and overall effectiveness of the writing.\n\nBased on these criteria, I would suggest a band score of 5 for this essay.

Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nA group of people believes that students should learn food science at school whereas other groups perceive the idea of gaining knowledge on necessary subjects. Both types of learning have advantages as well as drawbacks and this essay will highlight both sides of the situation.\nThe knowledge of food science is admired at some educational institutions where learners are expected to master this art. Students can gain numerous benefits by acquiring knowledge of food at the school level. For example, they become capable of making a career in the food industry or conducting further research on the science of food at the tertiary level. Therefore, some people prioritize gaining expertise in food science from schools.\nHowever, some scholars support the concept of learning only essential subjects for academic and professional purposes. Firstly, it is wiser to learn academic courses that provide enormous career opportunities for the future. For instance, learning subjects such as science, business studies, and sports can open the door to chances for a student. Secondly, the majority of the prestigious jobs in the world are related to technology, economics, and communication. As a result, studying these courses at schools prepares a learner to gain expertise and thrive in the professional sector.\nIn my opinion, students studying at schools should use their valuable time for learning essential subjects as it helps them succeed in the future. Courses such as food science can be learned at a later stage of life. For example, adult learners are able to join an academic course on food science as many institutions provide face-to-face and online courses in this regard. However, knowledge of subjects such as science, business studies, and arts is inevitable to achieve success in the future. Hence, the potential time of school students should be utilized to learn necessary subjects for a better outcome.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay addresses the prompt and presents both sides of the argument.

The first computers were built fifty years ago and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our everyday life. Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them.

The prospects for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that no individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of benefits but they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos.

Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go wrong. If one small program fails disaster.\nThere is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become increasingly complex. We should, however, ensure that we are still in a position where we are able to control technology. It will be all too easy to suddenly discover that technology is controlling us. By then it might be too late I believe that it is very important to be suspicious of the benefits that computers will bring and to make sure that we never become totally dependent on a completely technological world.

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nNowadays, smoking has become very common in many individuals. Although governments have been trying to prevent people from smoking by displaying many warning advertisements on medias, people struggle to stop smoking. There many reasons that explain this, like the addiction of tabasco, the social effect of smoking, and the lack of awareness about the effects from people. However, many ways to reduce smoking on society exist like the promotion of physical activity as well as medical treaments.\nEvidence strongly shows that the habit of smoking is triggered by the addictive side of tabasco. In fact, studies demonstrate that tabasco contain substances that affect areas in the brain which are reponsible of the feeling of pleasure and addiction. Thus, smoking becomes more and more pleasant and addictive. Moreover, smoking is a way of socialization for people. In fact, many individuals enjoy being gathered and discuss while they smoke a cigaret. They find it very relaxing and pleasant, so they do not plan to stop it as it allows them to meet new people for example. Nevertheless, I believe that the lack of awareness from people about the negative effects is a major component that explains why people do not want to stop smoking. Indeed, many surveys show that people do not know that smoking has several negative effetcs. They know about lungs cancer, despite it seems not to afraid them, but tooth and throat issues are less known in the vast majority of smokers.\nHowever, many ways exist in order to encourage people to stop smoking. In my opinion, physical activity and medical treatments are the most effective. In fact, governments have been investing a lot in the promotion of physical activity by the means of advertising campaigns. For instance, in the USA, surveys show that there is an increase of 20% of people doing physical activity in order to overcome their addiction issues related to smoking. Moreover, medical treatments have been improved over the last years so as to help people to cope with their addiction with smoking, and studies show that treatments are becoming more and more effective. For instance, in France, the number of smokers has decreased, and medical treatment is the second reason to explain this phenomenon, behind physical activity.\nTo conclude, even though there are many reasons that explain the addictive behaviours of people to keep smoking, I believe that there are several ways to improve this situation, particularly by the means of physical activity and medical treatments.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and effectively addresses the causes of smoking as well as ways to reduce it in society.

In fact, they believe that homework is a crucial part for the pupil education.\nPersonally speaking, I am convinced that homework are positive tools for scholar to remember and pratice what they have learnt in class, but it should be a small ratio rather than what they are currently asking.\nFrom my personal experience, I learnt that at the school age, children do not comprehend the importance of aknolwedge information in each different courses. As a result of it, pupil only focus on what they like, discarting subjects that are not in their taste and this is when homework plays a fundamental part. It helps scholar to fix in their memories the lesson they attended and from there building more ideas about it. Consequently, following the next courses will be easier for them. Not only does it help them to learn what has been thought, but also it gives them a method of study and habits which will be crucial for university or personal aknwoledgement. It set up the base to thrive on their own in the future.\nHaving said that, it is understandable if some people are against homework. Teachers might be given a heavy homework load to students, which is unfair because the children should also have the time to enjoy their childhood, playing and having fun.

Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nSince the industrial revolution, our economy has continued to expand and develop at an impressive increasing rate. Hence, many goverments worldwide believe that their primary objective is to focus on the development of goods and services. Others however argue that other sectors and their progress are of an equal value and thus similar effort should be made across the board. In this essay I will discuss why although focus on the economic progress can be benefical for a country, I believe that similar emphasis should be put into all sectors to greater our civilisation as a whole.\nFirstly, It is an undisbutable fact that by govermental bodies contributing more so to the growth of industries, it provides for a better quality of life. More money being distributed to businesses and industries allows them to grow and expand, not only offering more employment oppurtunities but greater availabilty of services. For example, In Ireland during the 19th century era of the 'Celtic Tiger',the goverment supplied most of it's yearly budget towards economy. This in turn saw that the country saw an overall downfall of both the unemployment rate and in contrast the manufactoring and establishment of more and more bussiness across counties. This thus highlights how by contributing towards economy, it boosts living standards.\nHowever, in order to contribute to a nations development, this can not be achieved by one sectors progress alone. It is believed by many that by putting emphasis into other fields, for instance education, transport and health, we can better a country as a whole. For example, Japan saw an increase in employment rates once the local government began to contribute more of it's spendings towards the expansion of third level instituitions. Having a better academic background encouraged more and more people to actually seek employnment from already established businesses, which they would not have ever dreamed of doing before holding a diploma. This in turn has had a rippling effect across generations as standards of living continues to surge. Additionally, by governements aiding in better health and transport availabilty, we evidentely aid to the better development of a nation. By having a means of travelling to and from work and similarly a means to take greater care of ourselves, we improve the quality of life of the people across that region.\nTo conclude, the economic growth process is one that continues to rise to date. Most governments believe that their key goal is the progress of this area. However, in my opinion, by equally aiding other sectors such as education, transport and health, we can further impact our economies growth and better the quality of lives for generations to come.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'This essay deserves a band 5.5 because it demonstrates some ability in addressing the task, organizing ideas, and using a range of vocabulary and grammatical structures.

The writer should have provided a more balanced discussion by giving equal attention to both views.\n\nSecondly, while the essay presents relevant examples to support its points, they are not well-developed or connected to the main arguments. The example of Ireland\'s economic progress in the 19th century is mentioned briefly, but the essay does not provide enough information or analysis to fully illustrate the impact of economic growth on living standards. Similarly, the example of Japan\'s investment in education is mentioned, but it is not clear how this relates to the overall argument of the essay.\n\nFurthermore, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the essay.

Another example that can provoke this type of behaviour is in the society idols. Promote bullying in series tv, movies or throught social media can misguide the idea of right and wrong in a pupil's mind.\nHaving said that, possible solutions to avoid children acting as bullys can be addressed. Firstly, in schools schould exist a zero tollerance policy towards this concept. Secondly, It should be put in place some code of conduct to direct scholars to understand which behaviour is accepted. Thirdly, they could be helped with counseling with a psycologist. Least but not last, bullying should be condemned.

Say why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nHobbies are recreational activities that are pursued away from one's school or work. They are meant to be an escape from the mundane and a way of keeping people sane and happy. Unfortunately, they have become almost a luxury in today's fast-paced world.\nSeveral reasons can account for this massive decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. One such reason is the fact that hobbies require time and money which are two very dear resources in today's world. Social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. What used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit. Even if one has the money to pursue such, he or she would have to set aside time in his or her busy schedule to enjoy those hobbies. It is therefore no wonder that most people found to pursue hobbies today are either wealthy youth or comfortable pensioners.\nSecondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. Most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. Such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. This is seen in a lot of Ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. Consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.\nMoreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. After a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.\nThis lack of hobby pursuit, though understandable, does the individual and society more harm than good. Many individuals today are being treated for one mental health or another. Hobbies are a good way to relax and destress through leisure and can go a long way to improve mental health. Its absence will only wreak havoc for the society, which will only consist of tired and apathetic individuals who could not care less about each other and their surroundings.\nIn conclusion, it is important, albeit difficult, to pay attention to hobbies in order to improve the health and psyche of the individual and society as a whole. More effort should be geared at encouraging hobbies at school and at the work place.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of language and a clear organization of ideas.

Say why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nNowadays everyone is suffering from the lack of time. People try to cope with everything and do their best all the time but we do not have superpowers or an ability not to sleep 24 hours. Honestly, I firmly believe that it is closely linked to not having a hobby these days.\nNeedless to say, time spent on the leisure activities plunged compare to the last century. I firmly believe that one of the main reasons is an addiction to the usage of various technologies. The majority of teenagers cannot live a day without their phone. They try to hide from troubles in that unreal world of communication. I understand that a hobby can also be online, for instance, videogaming but, as I know, really few people perceive it that way. Honestly, the problem is not only in the modern decade, adults also often do not have a specific hobby. The reason of that can be only their overworking and willingness to achieve more than they have at the moment. This race to the best never ends and, sadly, affects others too. Children adopt the habits of their parents. It is a green light for young people to behave in the same way, to think only about work and do not spend any time outside.\nOn the other side, obesity, bad mental health and demotivation can be an effect caused by not having a passion for any activity. I have a great example of the topic - it is me. I had played football professionally for 5 years until I decided to quit the training because of a sense of disinterest in what I do with my life. After, although I started to feel worse and worse, I could not do anything else. I spend all day at the computer doing homework now. I firmly think that I am not the only person who cannot handle with feelings such as anxiety or sadness. Maybe it could be better if I had a stronger character but I guess that a large proportion of my peers think that they would never get enough of joy, therefore it is not only my problem.\nTo sum up, it is clearly understandable that internet and ï¿½\x80\x9ctendency to be depressedï¿½\x80\x9d of present generation are rapidly displacing hobbies from human life. We need to think more about that problem because, in my opinion, we are really close to be as emotional and alive as robots.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a good command of the English language and addresses the prompt effectively.

To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nIn recent years, the advancement of cutting-edge technology has been elevating the quality of life of customers worldwide. However, the issue at hand is, some consumers face difficulties in choosing products from companies because there are surging numbers of advertisements from rival companies. This essay will examine the extent to where customers are impacted by advertisements and suggest viable methods to protect customers.\r\nTo begin with, I think that customers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent because their emotional decision-making as buyers are affected. Although some consumers believe that watching a Mcdonald advertisement on tv does not neccesarily encourage them to purchase foods from Mcdonalds, continously watching Mcdonald advetisements in a repetitive manner will subconsciously revert the customer's attention to order foods from Mcdonalds when they are hungry during late nights. In 2016, a study from Harvard University by Professor Oak mentioned that 75% of consumers who view the same imageries of advertising will began implementing it as a part of their lives. As a result, they become obese. Another point worth mentioning is, rival companies will tend to create an illusion of trust towards their products. If a loyal Colgate customer, a toothpaste brand, was convinced by Oral B through advertisements, another toothpaste brand that their product was better, they will potentially choose Oral B and rely on it permanently despite the fact that they have more flaws in their product. Hence, the customers will become emotionally manipulated.\r\nOn the contrary, there are a number of profound methodology to prevent increasing numbers of advertisements from influencing customers. One of the most notable ones is, the government should limit the number of advertisements published. Although an advertising company may lose attention from customers due to lack of the marketing, many customers will be able to focus on lesser advertisements that wastes significantly less of their time. Therefore, they will be able to enjoy more time watching the movie or series that they love. Moreover, another important solution that the government should investigate advertisement products displayed online. For instance, in some countries, baby milk powder was replaced with dangerous chemicals that resulted in food poisoning in babies. This caused severe trauma to consumers that re mianly family members worldwide. By implementing stricter control towards advertisement products, customers will be able to reap the rewards of the best products and move on with their life. Yales University states that by enhancing the quality of advertising campaigns despite the rivalry betweem companies, customers will be able to protect themselves from manipulation from marketing schemes. Therefore, customers will be safe from misleading products.\r\nIn conclusion, while I believe that consumers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent and create an illusion of trust towards their products, there are also viable measures to protect customers such as the government limiting the number of advertisements shown and investigating advertisement products displayed online.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Essay Re-evaluation:\n\n1.

Therefore, it is understanding if someone is afraid of it and prefer to have the same habits, spending their life doing the exact same circle of thing week after week. This is call comfort-zone. Everyone aims at it at some point of their life because it is reassuring, easy and releaxing. But does it brings in people's life important events or news? The answer most likely is no. If people do not go out of their comfort-zone, choosing changes over habits, they will never experience something new. In the long run people become unsatisfied, depressed holding negative thoughts and unhappy.\r\nOn the other side, changes are bringing new scenario in mankind's life that can improve, most of the time, their situation.

For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.\r\nIn extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.\r\nAnother reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.\r\nWhat I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.\r\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

Although teaching at home sometimes provided a more comfortable environment, I believe that making children go to school is better for their development.\r\nOn the one hand, studying at home always provides a comfortable environment for children. When children study at some place they live and stay every day, they tend to be more relaxed, it can encourage children to study in better efficiency. In addition, education plans can be customized if children are going to study at home, and maximize their advantages in talents. Take the case of Lang Lang, who was a famous Chinese musician, he was found talented in piano since he was the age of 5 and started long-term customized piano training at home, eventually becoming the champion of the Chinese national piano competition in his 20s. Furthermore, parents can take care of childrenÃ¢\x80\x99s study progression, difficulties, and mental health the first time, and make corresponding adjustments in time.\r\nOn the other hand, it perhaps better for childrenÃ¢\x80\x99s development to let them get used to go to school. Firstly, despite the comfortable, simple environment at home, children could not always stay inside their Ã¢\x80\x9cgreen houseÃ¢\x80\x9d once they grew up, they need to develop the ability to be compatible with the pressures that come from a more complex social environment, while school can be their first step to practicing such ability. Secondly, it is necessary for children to learn and apply team collaboration skills in order to overcome some difficulties that could not be solved by a single person. Finally, school is the first platform that enables children to develop their own networking, which is a kind of wealth that can help their personal development in the future. For example, many typical famous people like Napoleon Bonaparte, and Winston Churchill all started to develop strong social networking since they were in school, and the networking provided them with vital help on their path to success.\r\nIn conclusion, I can understand why people might want children to be taught at home, but I strongly hold the opinion that itÃ¢\x80\x99s better for childrenÃ¢\x80\x99s development to send them to school.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability.

By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.\r\nOn the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends.

Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nRecently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.\r\nTo begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.\r\nSecondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.\r\nTo conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong ability to address the prompt and provide relevant examples.

Every parent hopes that their kids can have better and more skilled to face the challenges in the future. At this time, extra classes came into being. Besides the lessons in school, children will attend different kinds of extra classes, such as classes on sports, maths, languages, arts.

In class , they get the knowledge from teachers and textbooks while after school they learn from experiencing the life, getting into nature and make connections by social skills. So I think students can have some extro classes not for studing the knowledge but for experencing, developing, and make themselves be themselves, become a whole person.\r\nMy son is an active boy who loves sports and he is into riding horses, play badminton and swimming. So I chose to take him to the club of horse riding on Tuesday after school . On Thursday, he will go to attend the swiming class with his friends. They not only learn the swimming skills from teacher but aslo have geat fun, and I always see his smiling face. I found that more sports and hobbies can really make the kids feel relaxed instead of some bored extra maths, languages classes.

But others think taking part in individual sports is better, like swimming. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nWith the prevalence of sports nowadays, whether taking part in sports as a team or an individual is more beneficial has sparked off a lively debate. While many believe that playing sports as teams can elevate one's teamwork skills, others believe that playing sports alone can develop self-determination and confidence. Given that sports can be played in either conditions, I would like to discuss both perspectives before giving my opinion.\r\nWhen it comes to sports, most people would think of team sports such as football, basketball and volleyball. These kinds of sports can help us to evolve important life skills. Especially for children, playing team sports is an indispensible method to develop interpersonal skills. Working as a teammate helps one to build relations and communicate with one another, distributing responsibilities. As a result, the skills the children learnt will be used to cope with future life as teenagers and adults.\r\nAlthough playing sports alone will not gain any benefits from what I have mentioned above, it will help us to establish skills for an individual, such as self-determination and confidence, as well as concentrate for a long period. For instance, individual sports such as swimming and karate, require sportspeople to build their bravery, as well as formulate techniques to face their opponents. Therefore, even though working in teams can develop better abilities, we should not overlook the fact that doing sports as one can also volatilize its advantage.\r\nHaving discussed how sports played alone and as a group can develop corresponding skills, from my perspective, I reckon that playing sports in teams is more beneficial.

Also, many team sports inevitably requires phyiscal contacts of the players, the competitive nature of such sports often intensify the contact which some leads to injuries. Many famous sportsmen, like Jianlian Yi, one of the only two Chinese basketball players in NBA, were forced to retire early due to the injuries sustained during matches.\r\nOn the other hand, individual sports like swimming and joggling do not have such issues. Since one can swim or run alone, there is no such need to compete with others and cause stress. The removal of physical contact with other players also reduce the likelihood of sport injuries such as head-to-head collisions. Plus, one would focus more on how to self-improve on his/her phyiscal abilities. Moreover, some individual sports like joggling and hiking encourage people to explore mother nature. According to a study done by UBC in 2005, the higher exposure to the nature, one will have lesser likelihood to suffer mental disorders such as major depressions disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD).\r\nIn conclusion, I would say sports that played individually is has more benefits than team sports, from both the physical and mental point of views.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and effectively discusses both views.

I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.\r\nFirstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.\r\nSecondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload.

39,307,"\r\nPrompt:\r\nSome people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nSome people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. This essay will discuss both these views with examples and show that while some people esteem physical strength, it is important to think of mental stretgth as a companion of physical strength which give any person in sports agility and flexibility.\r\nPhysical strength has been supported by many people as an important factor for success in sport. Those who think that physical strength is more important believe that it is a person's physique that is required to win any sport. For instance, in a study conducted by the Australisn National Team among sport fanatics in Perth, 80% of participants stated that physical strength was everything that any person involved in any kind of sport required to be succesful. Some participants in this study cited soccer as one such sport requiring physical strength. These findings were supported by another study conducted by a PhD student at the University of Sydney. The student concluded that while mental strength was important in any physically inclined sport, it was difficult to measure brain resources recquired to engage in sports like running.\r\nOn the other hand, some people think that mental strength gives stamina and agility to any person involved in sports. One prominent argument in this school of thought is that the body is a slave of the mind. Every action taken by the body is a response to the triggers initiated in the mind. Therefore, nourishing and strengthening mental capacity translates to physical strength. In a research study conducted among college students in America, it was found that mental strength was more esteemed than physical strength. It was argued in this study that mental strength was the breath that gave life to physical strength.\r\nIn conclusion, it can be argued that the reality of both mental and physical strength and their role in supporting a succesful sports career is not painted in black and white. A physically strong person needs to use their mental strength to plan and outwit their opponent. They also need tact and flexibility of the body which stem from the coordination between the body and the mind. As such, both mental and physical strength are important in supporting a successful sports career.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents relevant arguments and examples to support the writer's viewpoint.

Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.\r\nIn essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.\r\nNowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better.

For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.\r\nIn conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation.\r\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Revised essay: \nIt is commonly believed that individuals have little power to improve the environment and that only governments and large companies can make a significant difference. I strongly disagree with this viewpoint, as there are various ways in which individuals can contribute to environmental improvements. In this essay, I will provide reasons and examples to support my perspective.\n\nFirstly, individuals can utilize social media as a platform to raise awareness and encourage others to adopt eco-friendly behaviors. The power of social media is immense, allowing individuals to reach a global audience and influence their behavior. For instance, social media influencers can educate volunteers and collaborate with young people to promote environmental conservation. They can demonstrate the importance of waste sorting and highlight the harmful consequences of neglecting such practices.\n\nFurthermore, individuals can take direct action to benefit the environment without relying on government or company initiatives. While governments and companies should also play their part, individuals have the freedom to initiate positive changes. For example, individuals can reduce their carbon footprint by using public transport, conserving energy, and practicing recycling. By taking responsibility for their own actions, individuals can lead by example and inspire others to follow suit.\n\nIn conclusion, contrary to the belief that only governments and large companies can make a significant impact on the environment, I firmly believe that individuals have the power to contribute to positive change. Social media platforms offer a means to raise awareness and mobilize communities towards environmental goals. Additionally, individuals can take personal actions to directly benefit the environment. It is unnecessary to solely rely on the efforts of governments and large companies. By working collectively, individuals can educate the public and preserve the environment for future generations.'}]

Although striving for these ideals would benefit the individuals, I strongly believe that an ideal society can never be achieved because itÃ¢\x80\x99s unrealistic.\r\nStriving for an ideal society would benefit the individuals because nobody can live better unless they learn to think better. To begin with, virtues such as courage, fairness, and respect are admirable character traits that everyone should try to pursue. If individuals can become better versions of themselves, then the whole community would surely become better. Moreover, different people will have different versions of an ideal society. Hence, encouraging people to actively and critically think about how they can lead better lives will lead to a more open-minded, robust, and tolerant community.\r\nWhile itÃ¢\x80\x99s beneficial for individuals to work on self-improvement, an ideal society can never be created or maintained. Firstly, people are selfish and will pursue their self-interest at the expense of the group. If I can get ahead by taking more resources than my neighbor, then why shouldnÃ¢\x80\x99t I take more? Upon seeing me do that, others will envy and start taking more for themselves. Consequently, competition and discord within society are inevitable. Secondly, progress canÃ¢\x80\x99t be made unless stronger groups get ahead and wipe out less adaptable ones. Examples include factories replacing farming cultures and technology replacing manual labor.\r\nIn conclusion, although striving towards the ideals is beneficial to individuals within communities, the ideal society could never be achieved due to its impracticality. Schools, governments, and communities should nevertheless encourage people to actively think and work on becoming better versions of themselves.\r\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong understanding of the prompt and effectively presents the writer\'s opinion.

Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nEducation programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.\r\nOn the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.\r\nOn the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.\r\nTo sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and provides clear arguments for both sides of the issue.

47,330,"\r\nPrompt:\r\nThe typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nFor many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.\r\nWith the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?\r\nThere is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.\r\nAlso, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.\r\nIn conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.\r\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

What solution is better?\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nIn my opinion, the two solutions both have its pros and cons. But I think the first solution which is, create housing areas by providing taller buildings, is a better solution. Providing taller buildings can save the area of lands being use and can create more areas with green grass or trees that can help the environment. Also taller buildings can provide greater view and can be designed in creative ways. So does the buildings in cities can create a skyline which makes the city scenario more modern and breathtaking. On the other hand, if we choose to build houses on a wider area, the land will still, be eventually out of use. And they are likely to destroy wildlife or nature areas since places that has wide areas are mostly at the rural parts of the country. Also, houses wide spread in a large area can be crowded and can seem messy and not ideal for site. Although maybe some people will think that shorter buildings are safer when there is a fire or when natural disasters like earthquake comes, but the number of times these problems occur are low and modern technology can also help to lower the risk of people getting hurt.

Is it positive or negative development\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nStriving for own career development is most of the people's lifetime target in the modern city. In some nations, employees spend long time at work becomes a phenomenon. This essay is going yo discuss the reasons behind and I reckon that this is a negative development for both the companies and employees.\r\nThere are two main reasons behind this phenomenon. Firstly, it could be the corporate culture of the company. The management members of the company may agree that workers spending a long period of time in the office equals to excellent performance. For instance, employees in Japanese company could get a greater annual bonus or better chance to promote if they are eager to work for a long hours. This forces the employees to to show up in the office just because of giving a good impression to the boss.\r\nSecondly, as the competition between different companies in the market is nervous, coporate sectors are willing to push their colleagues to enhance their sales or performance. It causes a great pressure to the employees whom need to work for long hours to fuifill the expectation from the managements. For example, product sales agents' performance depends on the sales number quarterly. If the agent cannot sale the products effectively, they will receive less revenues or even being sacked.\r\nAs per the reasons stated, I absolutely think that it is a negative development for both the employees and companies. It is because it gives the unnecessary pressure to the colleagues which will affect their mental health. Inversely, it downgrades the performance of the employee as well as the company. Work-life balance is important to everyone as suitable relaxing time can considerably enhance the performance of human.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay shows a good understanding of the prompt and provides clear reasons for why people spend long hours at work in some countries.

Is it positive or negative development\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nIt is often the arguement and debate of the main reasons for why employees spend longer hours at their jobs and what are the consequences of it. This essay will argue this statement, provide top reasons and main outcomes of doing so and give some relevant examples.\r\nThere are several reasons why workers tend to spend too much time at their jobs, beyond the work hours stated in the contracts. One reason could be that those employees have recently joined the company and they want to leave a good impression on their supervisors during the three-month probation period. Another factor is related to the many various tasks and projects given all at once, hence they get stressed out as they're restricted with the deadlines. On the other hand, some are just staying at work for a prolonged period is for the sake of self-development, e.g. studying for some certification programs, online master degree, etc.\r\nWhen it comes to the consequences, it can be either positive or negative, depending on the reason itself. If it is self-development then it is a good thing. In contrast, if this keeps repeating everyday then it is unhealthy for both the body and the mentality. Also, it can affect the social life and a marriage relationship. As an illustration, some countries (such as Dubai) have reduced the work hours and the outcome of this study was found satisfactory, i.g. the employees have become more productive, fruitful, and the quality of their inputs drastically improved.\r\nTo sum up, the best and optimal choice is to balance between the social life and the time spent at work.

55,344,"\r\nPrompt:\r\nSome people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nSome people strongly argue that money has to be shared for other ways. In contrast, it is necessary to invest money for developing the technology for space exploration. Although there are some benefits to spend money for space exploration, I believe the money should be spent for a disparity of wealth and environment.\r\nInitially, developing the technology for space exploration is necessary to some extent. For example, if people found a drastically innovative resource on another planet that takes the place of current resources, specifically, fossil fuel, and wood.\r\nPeople do not need to take care of limited resources on the earth any more. In addition, improving technology will cause to people's convenience on earth as a result. For example, recently some scientists are planning to launch a space rocket as a transport system on earth. hat it takes only two hours between New York and Shanghai by rocket.\r\nOn the other hand, there are a lot of problems on earth. Especially, in developing countries, people are suffering from poverty while in developed countries waste massive food. In addition, even in developed countries, the disparity of wealth has been widening. Therefore, the money which is spent on space exploration should be used for all people's lives more safely around the world. Developed countries must have many options to give a hand to developing countries. For example, it must be effective to provide infrastructure, agriculture, and sharing clothing and food that are about to dispose of in developed countries.\r\nFinally, including my opinion, people can not choose their own nationality. This means that people who were born in a developing country and need to be suffered from poverty are definitely unfair.

As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider and people will be able to live with the same quality of lifestyle as developed countries to some extent.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates coherence and coherence with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.

My firm conviction is that it is rewarding to pour money into exploring outer space since it might produce long-term benefits.\r\nFrom a short-term pespective, there are seemingly compelling reasons to exclude space exploration from the national budget. The result of exploring the exterrestrial space is unpredictable. If research fails, it would be a loss of financial resources considering the huge cost. Besides, compared with space exploration, education inequality, health care problems and underdeveloped infrastuctures are more urgent issues, meaning that money spent on these facets may produce immediate benefits for people's quality of life.\r\nHowever, I firmly believe we should hold a long-term perspective and figure out potential merits brought about by exploring and researching the outer space. First of all, environmental problems, such as global warming and water shortage, are gradually worsening and threatening people's health to a large extent. Allocating financial resources on space exploration could further investigate and prove whether there are life forms or natural resources on another planet, which might provide a soultion to those long-exisiting environmental issues. Also, many exisiting technologies closely associated with the daily life of mainkind, such as weather forcast and earthquake anticipation, are also highly reliant on the space technology.

To what extend do you agree or disagree?\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nFor years, space has fascinated humans. The idea that there could be life on other planets, as well as the challenge of exploring as much of the universe as possible, has been one that has excited everyone from top physicists, to the youngest child playing with her space ship toys. But is the money spent on exploration of the universe justified or should it rather be allocated to helping those on this planet? I believe that space exploration is justified. In this essay, the motivation for space exploration will be explored.\r\nPlanet Earth is ill. Humans have polluted the planet and destroying natural resources. Some might argue that the damage is irreparable. Global warming is causing the Earth's temperature to steadily rise. There is a possibility that in the next few centuries, the planet may become inhabitable. Scientists like Elon Musk have recognised the dire situation that the Earth is in, and have started looking for an alternative new home planet. It is possible that in the coming years, there will be no other option than to move to a planet like Mars. Therefore, the costs involved in exploring this planet are justified, if it is to house the entire human race.\r\nSpace exploration also allows for new discoveries. New minerals or compounds could be discovered on distant planets. These could possibly be used on Earth in various new technologies, or even in medical science to treat illness or disease. This could be invaluable to humankind.\r\nSince the dawn of the human race, a characteristic that separates us from our animal relatives, is our ability to tinker with existing knowledge, as well as learn new things. It has lead to humans becoming the dominant force on the planet. New ideas prevent us from becoming stagnant, thus driving progress. If we continue to learn new things from space exploration, we prevent stagnation.\r\nLastly, the idea that there could be life on other planets is one that has merit, in my opinion. Humans cannot be so arrogant to think that there is no other life in the universe.\r\nIn conclusion, it can be argued that space exploration does not hold merit and should be discontinued. But the benefits that it offers outweigh the shortcomings.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': 'This essay provides a well-developed response to the prompt with clear arguments and examples.

60,357,"\r\nPrompt:\r\nIn many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nWith new technologies come new ways to communicate with people. First, we had emails and now we have social media and a variety of different apps that give us the opportunity to chat with one another. And this kind of online communication entered not only our personal but also our professional life. This topic is rather controversial and people have different opinions about that, so in this essay, I'm gonna be talking about pros and cons of the new type of working communication.\r\nFirst, I would like to start with some advantages of online communication at work. In my opinion, the main thing that makes people go from meeting face to face to talk online is the fact that it's more convenient. We don't have to set a specific date to meet someone. And also we can talk to someone from wherever we want, without needing to drive to the office. The two things we need are our cellphone or computer and the internet connection. But I think nowadays it won't be a problem for anyone because the majority of people have each of this stuff.\r\nThe second advantage - the functionality of apps for online communication. Let's take Zoom. I think almost everyone used this app in 2020 during lockdowns all over the world, including myself. You can arrange a meeting with thousands of people, using this app. This is much easier than gathering large amounts of people in one place. You can also record this meeting if you wish and send this recording to people who were absent or use it yourself in the future to remember all the details. Face to face meetings do not provide us with all these opportunities.\r\nIf we talk about disadvantages, I do not see a lot of them. The only thing that we can miss in online communication is the ability to see human emotions and facial expressions. I find it really important, especially when it comes to discussing important projects or deals. From my own experience, I can say that when there was a lockdown in my country due to the pandemic, I missed physical interaction with my colleagues, such as handshaking, etc. I find physical interaction to be an effective way for team building, so it's might be hard to work without it, using only online communication.\r\nTo conclude, I would say that everyone can have different opinions about whether it's better to meet online or face to face. But what I am sure about is that we should not get rid of face to face meetings completely. Otherwise, It will be hard to keep the team tigh-knit.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Essay Evaluation:\nOverall, this essay addresses the prompt and provides a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.

Some people argue that those experiences which a child faces before entering into school has more effect, whereas others believe that teenhood has profound influence on a child's future life. This essay will discuss in detail both the views and explain why i believe that both early childhood and teenage experiences decide what future holds for the child.\r\nThose people, who are in opinion that experiences in early childhood before the start of school has impact on future life, give several reasons. They believe that whatever a child faces at home helps in shaping his personality. For example, abusive childhood greatly has long lasting effect on their lives. It has been studied that those children who are victims of child abuse are more likely to become criminals. Some of them can never return towards normal life. Moreover, parents by their care and love can raise a child with a bright future. These children know the world from the perspective of their parents and it helps them to become a well-mannered and cultured human being with specific life goals, such as getting higher education or finding a job. In short, early childhood has its far reaching effects on a child.\r\nOn the other hand, people, who think that teenage experiences , especially at school, have more impact on determining the future of the person, have their own reasons to support their argument. Firstly, it is the phase of life where hormonal changes are taking place and they are experiencing body changes both mentally and physically; therefore, those who can have control on their emotions during this phase can develop as a strong individual. Secondly, it is the phase where most of the teenagers start taking decisions about their future study choices and any study experience at school help them in making these decisions. Such resolutions in teenage can have impact on their future practical lives. Finally, those youngsters, who are bullied during their teenhood at school, can suffer from personality disorder later in their lives which can have detrimental affect on their future. Surely, these experiences in teenage can affect a child's future.\r\nTo conclude, i believe that both pre-school childhood and teenage experiences help shape the future of a person.

70,372,"\r\nPrompt:\r\nIt is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nSome people believe that young children ought to breed animals and plant vegetables. This essay will argue about some pros and cons of children working as farmers, and also show that disadvantages overtake the benefits of it.\r\nOne the one hand, it is a fact that young children who work looking after animals and plants learn how to respect the environment and develop an elevated sense of responsability. Certainly, activities such as taking care of animals and grow vegetables favour children in many aspects of their lives, like to have a better health, mostly because of doing lots of outdoor activities and eating healthier food than city children.\r\nOn the other hand, if children learn how to work as a farmer, they could try to do it alone, without any supervision, which is surely a hard work, with a lot of difficult and responsabilties. In order words, those tasks could be dangerous to a child and affect negatively its live. For example, it is necessary to use some special tools to deal with vegetables, and those tools could harm easily a child. In addition, looking after animals and plants take too much time and children must spend their time studying and having fun instead of working.\r\nIn conclusion, although the benefits that people can find in teaching young children to deal with animals and grow vegetables, the disadvantanges of children doing those tasks are extremely high, because of some permanent damages which could be caused by dangerous tools. In my opinion, young children should learn how to do it but they must not do those activities even if they were supervised by adults.\r\n',"," 'evalutation': 'This essay demonstrates some strengths in terms of organization and language use, but there are several areas where improvements can be made.\n\n1.

71,375,"\r\nPrompt:\r\nIt is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nIt is advised that toddlers should learn about growing vegetables and raising animals. Although there are downsides to this proposal, the overall advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages in this matter.\r\nThe main advantage of teaching the younger generation how to farm vegetables and keeping animals is that it can enhance their understanding of the environment. There is no doubt that school kids could learn about the environment on books, but the most effective way is to interact with the habitation of vegetables and animals as they can easily be related with. In addition, by learning about foods and animals, children could quickly develop their awareness of not wasting food. Only when children realize how difficult and complicated it is to nurture food, can they stop wasting food or throwing food they dislike. For instance, public schools in Melbourne developed a targeted curriculum to supporting primary children to learn about the growth of foods and the significance of preserving the environment and reduce food waste. Hence, the advantage is obvious since younger pupils must recognise the world they live in.\r\nHowever, it is suggested that the physical risk of allowing primary offspring to learn about farming could not be overlooked. One of the root disadvantages of caring for animals is the safety issue as animals might have potentially harmful effects on young kids. To elaborate, there is a mixture of the hidden virus on animals' bodies, due to the fragility of children's immune systems, they are too vulnerable to defend against external viruses, not to even mention the physical attack from animals to children. According to the agricultural department, there are 300 cases of animals attacking children reported every year in China, which could be considered as a piece of strong evidence of the disadvantages.\r\nIn conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks of learning about animals and floras, the benefits of involving young toddlers in discovering about the environment still outweigh the downside.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of language and effectively addresses the prompt.

Outdoor activities can help them to talk with other people or play with other kids, including making friends. Moreover, childhood is the age of learning something new. They will learn something new all the time from us which can make them have a good attitude when they grow up. While playing games make themes lost of self-awareness for surrounding. As a result, outdoor activities teach children to be a good socializing\r\nAnother reason that I hold this view is about health. As I talk in the previous paragraph, childhood is the age of not only learning something new but also trying. Outdoor activities in terms of sports such as football or basketball can help not only connect with other kids but also make them healthy. Compared with playing computer inside their room which makes them diminish and hurt their eyesight.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nSome groups of society are having the idea that outdoor activities are vital for children to improve their mental and physical skills rather than gaming. In my opinion, I agree that crafts and physical interaction between kids are essential for their development in all aspects. Modern technology which contains computer games may have negative effects on their overall development.\r\nThe reason why I believe that such activities are important is that kids are building their personalities during the first years of their life, and this building process requires them to play and interact with their peers in real-life situations which without any doubt can not be done through online games that do not offer this rich experience to them. For example, when a child faces her friends and communicates with them face to face doing some activities, she will learn from them things that will contribute to her growth in many ways.\r\nIn addition to that reason, outdoor activities offer authentic exposure to different situations which helps children to learn how to deal and manage their actions which will increase their awareness, on the other hand, computer games can not provide the exposure that may be needed to achieve such benefits. To illustrate, children who play outside their houses with their mates generally will give a specific and quick response to different situations in contrast with those who spend hours infront of computer screens.\r\nIn conclusion, outdoor activities are valuable for what they give to children, not only for their personalities to be formed and developed, but also for their understanding to multiple real-life situations.\r\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a good command of the English language and effectively presents the writer\'s opinion.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nTo be a part of a modern society people must follow laws that are set in place by the superior authorities. Some agree that if there would be no rules, our society could not function the way it does now. This essay will argue why rules and laws are necessary for a functioning society.\r\nSome people have such high moral standarts, that even if there would be no rules, they would act exactly as they are with rules set in place. These people are geniunely kind and would never want to cheat ir cause harm to another person. It is not the law that makes them act this way, but rather their personality and values. This is why if everyone would be like this, no laws would be necessary, because people would act humane and want only the best for eachother.\r\nThe society we live in could not exist without rules and laws set in place to control it. Everyone is different and they have a different value system and understanding of what is an acceptable action and what is not. Some people believe that it is ok to steal from another, cheat or do harm to another person. Only thing that tries to keep them in place is our system law enforcement, that promises consequences if the rules are broken. For many people this is enough to live by the rules. However, even with the laws set in place, some still break them for their own benifit. If people commit crime, knowing that they can be punished for it, how many more would do harm if there would be no consequences to their action? For these reasons our world could not run without it being regulated by the system of law.\r\nTo conclude, even though some people naturally follow rules, it is not enough for a functioning society, because many others would feel free to do what they want to. Ultimately, our society could not function as it does now, if there would be no laws and rules to follow, and the possibility of serious consequences if those are broken.\r\n',"," 'evalutation': 'The given essay has several strengths that warrant a Band 7.5 score.

These examples help to strengthen the arguments and demonstrate a good range of vocabulary.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement in the organization and coherence of the essay. The essay lacks clear paragraphing, which affects the overall structure. It would be more effective to have separate paragraphs for each main idea, such as the importance of rules for individuals with high moral standards and the necessity of laws to deter crime.

Discuss both views and give your opinion\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nNowdays the developping of modern technologies in the trade sphere provokes a lot of discussions. Some people notice significant simplification in shopping process because of these technologies whereas the other part of society denies this influence. As far as I am concerned, shopping has definitely become easier due to invention of new payment decisions.\r\nOn the one hand it is really difficult to ignore the creation of new payment decisions in the last decades likewise internet acquiring or different mobile technologies like Apple Pay, Google Pay etc. The two key features of all these innovations have become, firstly, decreasing the number of steps in the payment process and absence of visualisation of your own money as well since you pay by card or by phone, not by your cash. Because of these changes now the shopping is really easier for us regarding spending our money without any possibilities for extra thoughts.\r\nAt the same time some people can declare that due to modernisation and development of technologies a lot of companies and factories have started to create a huge variety of goods. As a consequence, customers usually struggle with choosing of what they actually need. At this point of view it is possible to regard the modernisation not as something to make the shopping easier but as the opposite of it. To clarify, the faster development is going on, the more confused an average customer is becoming because the harder for him to choose something and buy it.\r\nAs for my personal opinion, I concern the progress as something that usually helps me to buy goods. To elaborate, I have never had any issues with choosing in the shopping that is why it is difficult for me to express some empathy to the people who feel uncomfortable with it.\r\nI can conclude thus that the question of technologies and their influence in simplification in shopping is debatable. There are some who spend their money easier then ever since the number of steps in the payment process has decreased, but there are customers who have issues and find the same process less comfortable. As for me, I am inclined to the first groop of people because I've also noticed a rised pace with that I've started to make my purchases.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents both sides of the argument.

It has been a part of history.If we look at the early 1800's or at early 1900's it was always classical music that garnered most attention and had people coming into concert halls to listen to musicians.It was an integral part of music in all countries.But with the evolution of music and introduction of more genres of music like Rock,Pop and Rap we have seen the rise in music which people found more appealing and intresting.\r\nThis has led to classical music being viewed as boring and stagnant, this can be viewed as the primary cause in fall of the popularity of classical music.\r\nFor example, going to a rock and roll concert which gets people involved and also allows them an opportunity to partake in the concert, which as you could understand would appeal more to the youth as compared to a classical concert where people would just view and appreciate with minimum involvement.\r\nClassical music is also a skilled art that needs to be learned and honed but does not integrate any modern art. For example, Michael Jackson integrated dancing with his singing which widely appealed to the masses and encouraged youth into his concerts. So if you could see a similar integration with classical music concerts it could attract more youth towards classcial music.\r\nHowerver, with this discussion we cannot forget that as various genres of music have been derived from classical music and youth learning classical music with attending more classical concerts would help them achieve their future music endevors and also give them a good understanding of music.\r\nIn conclusion, we can say that young people should be encouraged to go to classical music concerts as it would help them understand and appreciate music in its true form.However, attracting young towards classical music will need a evolution in classical music concert structure and integrate some components from other forms which would make it blend better with present day outlook.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Essay Evaluation:\n\n1.

Humans in the world, in the present day do many paramount activities which are breathtaking, changing from hang-gliding to mountain climibing. In my opinion I think this is a good change for peoples lifes, under two considerable reasons, such as people get more life experiences in nature and for their physical fitness. In this essay I will ounline my opinion and provide reasons with valid examples.\r\nOn the one hand, human begins are under the pressure of globalisation, which leads them to get more trendy experiences from nature. Since younger generation is working towards the urban development of the world they are living in large cities full of pollution and high rising buildings. When ever they find enough spare time youngsters are trying to enjoy their lifes by climbing mountains which is hiking from the technical term. To contrast this gives them the opportunity to learn more about the outside world of cities, get more experience in mother nature. They develop their knowledge about the surroundings, such as the animals, birds and different flora and faunas. As an example one of my friends wanted to do the activity of flying which this is an human made activity, but after few findings through the internet and she seeing pictures how people enjoy hiking she decided to go on a trip to Mount Everest for climbing.\r\nOn the other hand, people, or the young generation have the sense that activity of flying apparatus are outdated and this is not providing then enough physical fitness to burn their calories. Due to these reasons some group of young as well as old people climb mountains to develop their well-being, mostly people such as athletes and humans who are having various diseases such as obesity, adore to do hiking.\r\nTo sum up, in my opinion this trend is not a bad idea for the poeple to get escaped from their busy lifestyles to enjoy the nature as well as develop their fitness rather than going to artificial equipment based buildings. In fact, every sport has their own risk, so people need to accept and beware of these risky issues and attend these activities.\r\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a sufficient level of English language proficiency, but there are areas that need improvement in order to reach a band 7.0 score.

Some people believe that physical punishment is important to improve behaviour. While others totally disagree with that. In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.\r\nIn terms of people who agree with the student's punishment, they think that students need it to improve their attitude and to be good at school. To illustrate, when teachers physically punish students, Students will follow their instructions and avoid doing mistakes. In addition, other students will be carefule when they think to do any wrongs to avoid the punishment.

Secondly, theses students will hate going to school and continuing their education in the future due to this punishment.

83,401,"\r\nPrompt:\r\nThe use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nSome people believe that modifying behaviour among school-going children can be achieved through corporal punishment, and that it being on the decline in schools, is actually a negative development. I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.\r\nImprovement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.\r\nMoreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school.

I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.\r\nImprovement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.\r\nMoreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. The behaviour is most likely to get worse, instead, as learners become fearful and resent their learning environment. For instance, in South Africa, some learners were reported to be disrespectful to their teachers because of a bad relationship that existed between them and their teachers as a result of corporal punishment that was inflicted on them. While it may be true that some positive behaviour changes were seen among pupils due to use of corporal punishment, this is at a very small scale.\r\nIn conclusion, I am of the view that the use of corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it is unlikely to produce any required behavioural changes.

Nevertheless, the widespread use of internet triggers an intense debate. Some people hold that the use of internet should fall under control, while others disagree and argue that such control is groundless. This essay will analyse both positions and illuminate my standpoint.\r\nAs for those who support the control of the internet use, they may have their position grounded upon the fact that criminal activities run rampant online, threatening individual and public security, as exemplified by hacking technology aimed at stealing personal data illegally, fraudulent advertisements aimed at cheating money and notices post by terrorist groups brainwashing the public. Such activities, if unchecked, may exert undesirable effects on individuals and society. Given such omnipresent dangers online, the control of online activities may be justified.\r\nOn the contrary, in terms of those objecting to the control of the internet use, they may justify their position by highlighting importance of unlimited online activities, as demonstrated by the improvement of work efficiency. A case in point is that posting advertisements online is apparently more efficient than issuing leaflets on a street, from the perspective of a company intending to publicising its services and products. However, the notices post online may present fake information cheating the public. To address this issue, it is necessary to control online activities.\r\nAs far as I am concerned, in view of omnipresent hazards online, intervention is needed to screen dangerous information and ensure the safety of the internet use.\r\nTo conclude, the control of online activities helps to protect us from various cybercrimes, although it may slightly affect the efficiency of work.

Therefore, the total population in the country seems to be not changed, but the balance of the population has been widening in a few decades. I would like to share some example in Japan and suggest ideas to reverse its population in the countryside.\nMainly, job opportunities in the big cities are much higher than in the countryside. The majority of companies and foreign company branches tend to be located in Tokyo, and Osaka. Therefore, people need to move to the big cities or suburbs area to get their jobs. This means that real estate, house, and apartment prices have been soaring drastically. Moreover, the phenomenon connects to the prices rise up in a variety of industries. For example, the food prices in the restaurants need to raise due to monthly tenants payment has been surging. Therefore, people can easily get or change their job in big cities, it is not necessarily wealthy.\nNevertheless, ironically, since Covid-19 widely spread worldwide, many companies launched remote work. Even now, the majority of people do not need to commute to the office. In addition, some companies declare that they never change the working system in the future, because they have already systemized the IT system which is able to work remotely. Therefore, this is a great chance for the Japanese government to dissipate the population in local cities. If people start to move to local cities or countryside, the population in the local cities or countryside increased. It will be not only helpful for people to live there with reasonable prices, but also for effective economic growth in the local cities and countryside. In addition, the local governments will be able to organize the infrastructure, roads, medical care, and education. As a result, the quality of the infrastructure will be close to the big cities.\nFinally, if the government financially supported this remote working system to companies, the above phenomenon will be available. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider, and people will be able to get job opportunities with living in the countryside.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""This essay demonstrates some strengths in terms of organization and ideas, but it also has several areas that need improvement.

In my opinion, some of the causes might be the transition from agricultural to technological economies and the lack of support from governments to coutryside economy. I will suggest that major support and promotion of the agricultural services might encourage people to stay at coutryside.\nThe national migration is a well-know fact that happen into the countries as a product of technological advancements and its impact in the national and international economy. The service sector is nowadays the main activity within the countries, which resulted in more opportunities along the the cities of the world because this sector is mainly located in cosmopolitan areas, therefore, rural people have decided to emigrate to the cities seeking to improve their standard of living.

This lack of support, encourage the movement of people as a negative side effects in the cities because of overcowded populations.\nIn order to mitigate the overcrowded populations accross the cities in the world, it is crucial to support and promote the country side economies to avoid the movement of people domestically.

If farmers find the adecuate support to produce the farms, they are less unlikely to abandond their lands because they already have a livelyhood.

However, this rapid migration has led to popluation explosion in cities which seems to put tremendous pressure on available resources. In order to restore normalcy, this movement ought to be reversed and this can be done in a number of ways.\nTo begin with, the most common reason why people move to urban centers from rural areas is the fact that urban areas provide a wide range of opportunities that enable people to live a better life. For instance, all major metropolitan areas in the world provide access to state-of-the-art facilties in healthcare and education. Needless to say, both these aspects are the piilars of a good quality life that every individual desires to live. Unfortunately, as rural areas generally lag far behind in both these aspects, people are forced to migrate to cities. Moreover, urban dwellers are undoubtedly benefitted by advancements in all avenues of inquiry compared to their rural counterparts. This is because of the speed with which urban areas are able to incorporate these advancments into their infrastructure. While it may take a couple of months for a technological innovation to make its way to a village, it is not uncommon to see resdidents of a city making use of that innovation within no time. Thus, it makes perfect sense for people to leave the countryside in order to settle in cities.\nHowever, cities are suffering from a host of problems because of large number of people opting to settle here. Firstly, accomodating a burgeoning population is a grave challenge that grips cities. This can be circumvented by providing villages with the basic facilties essential to support life. This would deter people from migrating to cities. Besides, if attempts are made to integrate rural areas into the mainstream, they would be benefitted by latest technological developments and people would no longer feel the need to move to cities in order to take advantage of those advancements.\nTo conclude, although there are many reasons why individuals are migrating from the countryside into the cities in many parts of the world, if development in rural areas is emphazised upon, this trend could be reversed.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

90,416,"\nPrompt:\nThe movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nNowadays population of the cities have grown bigger than in the countryside. I will write about my thought of the cause of the movement from the countryside into the cities, and if there is a possibility to reverse this event, what it will be.\nFirst, I think the cause of the movement is partly because of the difference of the convenience, and the work types you can get between in the countrysides, and in the cities. Personally I do prefer to live in the countrysides, but I can't bare if there are none or slow internet connections there. Also I think the varieties of the jobs you can get are quite different in each location. For example, when I went to Australia to get jobs, of course people tend to stay in the cities so that they can get easy, fancy city jobs like waiter/waitress, shop retail, jobs related with news papers and so on. However the number of jobs are limited. I really wanted to stay in the city, but the amount of money you get was not quite enough to pay rent, and holiday fee, so I moved into the countrysides which had varieties of farm jobs. Sure there were easy jobs like in the cities, but the number of shops, and restaurants are quite small, and they were hiring mostly local people rather than working holiday workers. There I got a farm hand job in the tomato field. It was really hard job. We needed to work from 7 am when the sun rises to 6 pm when the sun sets. It was hard for my poor body, too. That is why I think most people move to the cities rather than stay in the countrysides.\nAlthough I am not sure if there is a possibility to reverse this event, I think there are quite a lot of good experience you can only get in the countrysides. One thing I can say is the people and the living pace are slower, and more relaxed in countrysides than in the cities. For example like I myself said, I prefer living in the countrysides than in the cities. In fact I moved to Edmonton in Canada, which is a city, but I'd say more like a town, but a lot more relaxed than Tokyo where I used to live. Sometimes people living in the crazy fast cities like Tokyo, New York, and etc actually want to slow down the pace to more relaxing cities, or countrysides. If we want to reverse this movement, I think you need to advertise what benefits you can get in the countrysides. For example, they have quite magnificent views, good benefits to raise your kids, and so on. I think it can really reverse the movement because nowadays people are so interested in the educations of their kids, so scientifically we need to prove that living in the countrysides, and raising the children can be really beneficial for them. I myself have 2 children, and I can feel the benefits of living in the countrysides. The more free time they have, the more creative they become, and I strongly believe the more creative they are, the more happier they can lead their lives.\nAs a result, I believe that we can reverse, or slow down the speed of the movement of the people from the countrysides into the cities if we empharsise the benefits of raising kids in the countrysides more.\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay deserves a band 7.5 on the IELTS writing criteria.

"," 'Criterion 1: Task Achievement\n\nThe essay addresses the prompt by discussing the causes of the movement from the countryside into the cities and suggesting a possible way to reverse this trend.

In this essay I shall try to cover some reasons for this trend as well as provide a number of solutions.\nTo start with, we have to consider the logic behind this movement. Firstly, as a rule, the countryside does not have enough educational institutions, so after finishing high school most students are obliged to move to other parts of the country in order to obtain higher education and, eventually, apply for well-paid jobs that are available only in bigger cities. Secondly, despite being provided with basic services, people still feel the lack of entertainment facilities, such as cinemas, theaters and others. In other words, most of the rural population is bored and have nothing else to do, that is why they are bound to immigrate to urban areas.\nLuckily, there are a number of solutions, which could be implemented and, hopefully, they can solve or, at least, ease the situation. Initially, it is vitally important that the government allocates more funds to rural areas and use this money for construction of public amenities such as hospitals, schools, kindergartens, and others. If those facilities were introduced, then villagers would have fewer incentives to move. The second option that we have to consider is to promote living in the countryside by providing tax cuts, subsidies and other measures of economic stimulation, which could prove to be effective in the long run.\nAll things considered, it can be clearly seen that the lack of facilities and money are the two most important reasons as to why more villagers move to the cities. Unless the government provides a number of economic incentives along with public facilities, it might be difficult to overturn this trend.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong understanding of the prompt and effectively addresses the causes of the movement from countryside to cities and potential solutions.

92,420,"\nPrompt:\nBoxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nBoxing is a dangerous kind of sport that may cause physical injury. Some people tend to believe that this sport should not exist nowadays. This controversial statement has both advantages and disadvantages, which will be discussed in this essay.\nA tremendous number of people think that boxing is an excellent way to fit a body and improve coordination. For instance, if parents want their kids to know how to defend themselves, they let them attend boxing masterclasses. However, the main aim for parents is to find a skilled, experienced coach for their children. They may think if a teacher is an expert, their kids will not suffer during training. Notwithstanding, it does not always work like that.\nOn the other hand, a lot of people completely disagree that boxing as a business industry has a right to exist in the modern world. They are convinced that people who fight should not suffer because of the wishes of rich people who enjoy the show. For example, if a young person gets a physical injury during a fight, he will probably get money for that; however, it does not mean that he will get better after the final battle. Also, people who protest against this blood sport probably dislike advertisements related to boxing. They may think that even these videos impact people's behaviour and motivate them to commit violence against others.\nIn conclusion, boxing is a part of the blood business that should be forbidden in the modern age. From my point of view, if a person wants boxing nowadays, there are a lot of different ways to do it, like VR simulation, without harming other people.\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay addresses the prompt and presents arguments for both sides of the issue.

Is it a positive or negative trend?\n\nEssay: \nCompetitiveness is a desirable quality for individuals. This essay will analyse the effects of competitiveness on people and illuminate my view as to whether the eagerness of competition represents an auspicious or ominous tendency.\nThere are mainly two types of influence exerted by competitiveness on people. The most prominent repercussion resides in that the desire of competition drives people to work or study more diligently in order to stand out from the rest and achieve success. Such diligence enables people to accumulate sufficient experience that helps them improve capabilities and obtain better results. Apart from that, another important effect of competitiveness is that competitors may seek considerable pleasure in competition, especially when defeating competent rivals and obtaining hard-earned victories. Such success makes people realise how excellent they are and gives them tremendous satisfaction. Even if losing the competition, people may still be satisfied with such a precious opportunity that helps them understand their disadvantages and thus, encourages them to work harder.\nAs far as I am concerned, I opine that competitiveness is a positive phenomenon, because it not only helps people become industrious learners or workers with sufficient experience and great potential of making progress, but also makes their daily lives more enjoyable as beating strong opponents may give them a unique sense of satisfaction. Therefore, I think that the importance of competitiveness should never be underestimated.\nTo sum up, the effects of competitiveness can be manifested by the impetus driving people to work or study harder, and the unique pleasure of competing against strong rivals.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nEssay: \nSome people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. On the other hand, others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. This essay will discuss both views and my opinion.\nSome people insist that punishment is a priority as culprits have gone agaisnt ones country's law. When they serve more years in prison, there is no chance for them to re-commit crime. In addition, some suppose that those who can not afford themselves, will feel better in the prison. As prisoners have to live in a systmatized cycle, they do not need to plan their budget and life. There is interview with an offender who continuously commits crime to go back to the prison.\nContemporarily, others say that there are better ways to reduce crime, such as rehabiliation and education. Most offenders lack moral value. Furthermore, they mostly have wrong mindsets or thoughts as some have never been educated properly. Therefore, other people think that education is better way to improve prisoners' behaviour. Society ought to give an opportunity to re-start their life again.\nI agree more with the second view. Obviously, we have to punish those people whoever break the law. However, punishment should not be a priority. Education is important. Community need to lead a way for them so that they can re-born as a totally different person. There is a statistics of crimes rates in the United States of America which implicits that strict punishment and longer prison sentences reversely led to an increase in crime rates. Therefore, the government needs to concentrate more on education and rehabiliation rather than security and control.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Re-evaluated Essay:\n\nSome people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime, while others argue that there are more effective strategies to achieve this goal. In this essay, we will examine both views and provide our own perspective on the matter.\n\nOn one hand, proponents of longer prison sentences argue that strict punishment serves as a deterrent to potential criminals. By imposing harsh penalties, individuals may think twice before engaging in illegal activities. Moreover, longer prison terms prevent offenders from committing further crimes during their incarceration, thus reducing the overall crime rate. Additionally, some argue that imprisonment provides a structured environment for those who may be unable to sustain themselves financially, offering basic necessities and stability that they would otherwise lack.\n\nOn the other hand, critics contend that there are alternative methods to reduce crime that prove more effective. One such approach is rehabilitation and education. Many offenders lack proper moral values and have distorted mindsets due to a lack of education. By providing them with educational opportunities and focusing on their personal growth, society can help them reintegrate into the community and lead law-abiding lives. Offering second chances can foster a sense of responsibility and encourage individuals to make positive changes.\n\nPersonally, I am inclined to side with the latter view. While it is crucial to administer appropriate punishment to those who break the law, it should not be the primary focus. Education plays a vital role in shaping behavior and attitudes. By providing prisoners with access to educational programs, we can equip them with the necessary tools to reintegrate into society successfully. Research conducted in the United States of America illustrates a correlation between strict punishment and longer prison sentences, and an increase in crime rates. Therefore, it is imperative that governments prioritize education and rehabilitation rather than merely focusing on security and control.\n\nIn conclusion, while some individuals assert that longer prison sentences are the most effective means of reducing crime, others argue that alternative measures such as rehabilitation and education offer better outcomes. Personally, I believe that education plays a crucial role in reforming offenders and reducing recidivism. Therefore, governments should emphasize educational and rehabilitative programs to ensure the successful reintegration of prisoners into society.'}]

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nEssay: \nNowadays, due to increasing of crime rate, some people tend to think of the best way to decline crime is giving a longer prison sentences. However, some criticisms probably believe that there should have much better ways to decrease crime. In my opinion, that is true to some extent for this statement. That means the prison sentences may be necessary, but I perfer the other ways such as education and detenion center rather than the prison sentences, especially for minors.\nFirstly, it is possible to said that increasing the punishment would decline the crime in the society. Considering the fact that most of citizens afraid to lose their freedom as a longer time. Given the circumstance, Hong Kong goverment established a policy which force people to scan the QR code with the Leave Home Safe app for against the Covid-19, it was not very common initially without any punishment, yet after announcing the 10-year prison sentences amd 60-throusand-dollar fines, HongKongers use the app quite often now. So that probably means that the more punlishment they will get, the more attentive and cautious they will have.\nOn the other hand, it seem likely to have another proper ways to reduce the crimes . One example is creat a better and well-rounded education for people, particularly for youngsters. Some people could think of it is a more efficient way to develop and nurture thier manner for their whole life. For example, there are a lot of different kind of extra curriculums which consist of having a talk with polices and ICAC for students to join and teach them some form of concept to be a good citizen and take their responsibilities living in Hong Kong. Perhaps, it can show them some societal expectation rather than arresting them and destroy their future.\nTo summarize, there are different opinions for this statement. Even so, I believe that if we had spoon-feed information and set a better model for people, it will help people to reflect on their bad behaviour. Likewise, if goverment only established a lot of punishment for his residents consisently, they may feel stress out.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nEssay: \nBased on some alledges, publicity is the main reason for the high rate of selling not humans' requirements. Although in my point of view, commercials are impressive in realms that people are looking for to address their demands. However, some other factors are uttered here.\nOne of the most highlighted contributors has to do with the high quality of accepted brands among their rivals. To enlighten, some domestic brands that have been even supported by both public and similarly authorities never can compete with other abroad commodities, as, not only in the real of quality but in terms of price also they cannot attain any level among other imported things. As a vivid case, Japanese cars are utilized in the majority of countries, while other companies, such as American ones, have lost their attraction owing to their high rate of consumption of fossil fuels.\nFurthermore, based on the alternations that have taken place in the world, like either the increasing population or the change of lifestyle, both the type and as well the number of substances that used to be utilized have undergone drastic shifts. For instance, individuals' usage of fast foods has skyrocketed in the last decade, due to the lack of time for cooking, hence the development of takeaways is eye-catching while the number of their customers has swelled sharply.\nOn the other hand, whereas advertising has been effective for some international firms, it would not be feasible if the improvement of transportation did not emerge. To illustrate, the main role is played by second-to-none commuting systems for delivering divergent products, therefore without their assistance, introducing goods to other parts of the universe seems to be meaningless while society does not have access to them as their choices.\nTo conclude, while publicity, nowadays, is exploited as a means for enhancing the chance of selling in different markets, to me, it is impossible to become prosperous if folks do not need those things. Nevertheless, other justifications that are associated with the appeal of various merchandise, namely their quality, should not be ignored.\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay demonstrates some understanding of the prompt and presents a clear opinion.

In Japan, because of this phenomenon, many people are influenced this country might be more dangerous than they thought. I disagree with these tendencies and should focus on more positive developments, including entertainment.\nTo go into detail, in Japan, once people turn on the TV in the morning. People face often face some news reports about a murder case, who were murdered, who is the criminal, and background details. In addition, there are more than 5 channels on TV, these all 5 channels broadcast the same incident at the same time. The Japanese government might take the control of media in order to agitate people to keep their attention on safety. It might be important to some extent, but it is not necessarily a good influence on people's mind if they were required to watch such a fierce, and negative incident every morning.\nIn contrast, when it comes Japanese crime rate, and case. They reached a peak of 2014, and keep decreasing until now. The cases are not significant derrence, compared with a few dacase ago. In addition, almost Japanese crimes tend to be petty crimes, such as thefts, frauds, shop lifting, and so on. In terms of the murder case, Japan is ranked as the 5th safest country among 160 countries in 2017. This means that the more media reported the savage crimes, people misunderstand Japanese society is getting more dangerous than a few decades ago.\nFinally, it is understandable to report such a heavy incident to some extent. On the other hand, they should also report positive and attractive news, such as tourism, especially inbound sales figures has been increasing and contributing to Japanese economic growth, and some Japanese athletes have been successful in MLB(major league baseball), and football. This news must be more fascinating for Japanese people to encourage their own national identity.\nIn conclusion, this is not a black-and-white issue.

If some heavy incidents happened, the Japanese government should restrict TV companies to broadcasting only one channel, or limit the time shorter.\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay demonstrates a fair understanding of the prompt and presents relevant arguments.

Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?\nLet us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).\nMoreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.\nOn the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes. But I am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals, rather than a problem of today's media system. People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.\nFinally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and presents a clear argument.

In this essay, however, I will discuss both points of views.\nTo start with, the fact that some people consider music a bad influcence is understandable especially when considering idolisation of musicians among young people. For example, the effect that the current world wide sensation Korean boy band, BTS, have on a lot of young people is unexplanable. Many youngsters have idolised this group to the extent where it affects their education and life in general. Definately, parents of children affected by this group will not be happy with their activities and will therefore develop negative feelings towards them. Furthermore, as many more young people lose focus because of their love for music and musicians, the society suffers in the long run because these people are less likely to be productive members of the society.\nMoving on, music also has a number of positive effects on people and societies. The first being that it is actually a lucrative source of livelihood for those involved and It also creats job opportunities. To explain further, musicians do not work alone, they need to be managed, they need a stylist, a make-up artist, song writers, graphic designers, to name a few and all these positions create an opportunity for young people to fill them. Furthermore, music is a good way to relax and calm one's mind. This method is even employed in therapy to aide the treatment or management of some anxiety disorders. Lastly, considering its effect on societies, the contribution of the music industry to a nations economy cannot be overlooked. Its contribution has always been tremendous and many times, important political figures have awarded musicians that have played a huge role in not only the economy of the country but her public image as well. For instance, very recently, the president of South Korea awarded BTS for their contribution, through their music, to the growth and international recognition of the country.\nIn conclusion, despite the controversy, in my opinion, the effect of music has more pros than cons on both individuals and societies because the industry not only creates job opportunities, music can also be used for the management of some mental health disorders and finally, it contributes a lot to a country's economy.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Essay evaluation:\n\n1.

Some people are the view, that countries should increase their production and that this is an appropriate aim. I strongly believe, that countries should not increase their production of such goods and resources.\nFirstly, the market will tell countries how much of these resources are needed. Therefore, the need of constantly enlarge their production is not necessary and additionally, a negative aspect can be, that companies will not be able to sell their products. By regulating production, countries areto make their products expensive if there is a high demand or cheaper if there are not enough buyers. For instance, if much steel for construction is needed, the countries which exploit that resource will be able to ask for a higher price.\nFurthermore, countries with many natural resources can't access their goods at any time due to lack of machinery or power and workforce. For example, during the pandemic, many Chinese companies have been working in low mode. Now, that various countries have started to open up, China can not keep up with the demand and produce all the goods due to a power shortage, indeed. This development will bring many severe consequences for the local and international economy.\nOn the contrary, by growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production, they can also make harm to the environment which will bring numerous consequences such as waste water pollution, high emission levels.\nIn brief, despite some short-term economic incentives, I strongly believe, as stated in the paragraphs above, that the need for that increase in goods and resources is not necessary.\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay addresses the prompt and presents a clear position on the issue.

Let\'s evaluate it based on the four criteria of IELTS writing: Task Achievement, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy.\n\n1. Task Achievement:\nThe essay partly addresses the prompt by discussing the benefits and drawbacks of information technology. However, it lacks a clear and direct thesis statement that answers the question of whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. The writer briefly mentions the benefits but focuses more on the drawbacks. To improve this criterion, the writer should provide a clear opinion and support it throughout the essay.\n\n2. Coherence and Cohesion:\nThe essay lacks a clear structure and organization. It consists of two paragraphs that discuss the benefits and drawbacks separately. The ideas are not logically connected, and the writer jumps from one topic to another without providing smooth transitions. Additionally, the writer uses repetitive phrases like ""information technology"" and ""personal privacy"" instead of using pronouns or synonyms. To improve coherence and cohesion, the writer should use a clear paragraph structure, provide topic sentences, and use appropriate linking words to connect the ideas.\n\n3. Lexical Resource:\nThe essay demonstrates a limited range of vocabulary. The writer repeats words and phrases, which affects the overall quality of the essay. There are also some errors in word choice and collocation. For example, ""enhance the bond"" should be ""strengthen the bond,"" and ""reseive"" should be ""receive."" To improve this criterion, the writer should aim for a wider range of vocabulary and use more precise and appropriate words.\n\n4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy:\nThe essay has several grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement mistakes and incorrect verb forms. For example, ""There in no denying"" should be ""There is no denying,"" and ""can not"" should be ""cannot."" The writer also lacks sentence variety and tends to use simple sentence structures. To improve this criterion, the writer should work on grammar accuracy, use a variety of sentence structures, and pay attention to subject-verb agreement.\n\nBased on the evaluation of the four criteria, this essay would likely score around Band 5 or 5.5. It addresses the topic to some extent but lacks clarity and organization. The language used is relatively basic, and there are noticeable errors in grammar and vocabulary. Improvement in content development, coherence, vocabulary range, and grammar accuracy is needed to achieve a higher band score."

Humans faced serious natural disasters in the past and climate change was just one of them. With the adjustment skill that we have, we always found a way to stay alive and made it through until today. From this prespective, today's changes in climate change can be accepted and with a few adjustment in our life styles, it can be treated as another disaster in history that humans have been through.\nHowever, if we do changes to learn live with climate change, it will cause us to drop our life quality in daily bases. For instance, air pollution will become a huge problem with the climate change and if we just adapt ourselves to live with it, we have to wear face masks everyday to reduce its harmful affect to our metabolism and this will limit our breathing. On the other hand, if we try to prevent climate change, we can keep the same way that we are living today.

Traditional culture does not only refer to the festivities, customs, norms etc. It refers to the 'life' as a whole, which is slower than the more enhanced life brought to us by technological developments.

The compatibility between technology and traditional cultures is indeed questionable, as they serve different purposes and values. While I partially agree with this view, I believe that there are both positive and negative aspects to consider.\n\nOn the positive side, the integration of technology in our lives has made it much easier and more convenient. Traditional culture encompasses not only festivities, customs, and norms, but also the overall way of life, which has been significantly influenced by the slower pace of traditional practices. For instance, the invention of cars revolutionized transportation. Prior to their development, horses were used to pull carriages over long distances. However, the advent of cars provided a considerable upgrade, bringing forth numerous benefits. Firstly, it resulted in cost savings. Horses were living beings that required continuous care, and their eventual death led to substantial expenses for carriage drivers who had to purchase new horses. The invention of cars eliminated such ongoing costs, making it a one-time investment for drivers.\n\nOn the other hand, the negative aspect lies in the potential loss of centuries-old traditions that hold significant cultural value and nostalgia for communities. Indigenous African communities, for example, have preserved their unique traditions for hundreds of years. However, these traditions are now gradually disappearing as members of these communities are enticed by the better job opportunities and advancements offered by technology. This leads to a decline in the practice of traditional customs and a loss of cultural identity.\n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the inevitability of traditional cultures being overshadowed by technology, I have mixed feelings about the extent to which they will be lost. The advantages brought by technological developments, such as convenience and efficiency, cannot be denied. However, it is crucial to consider the negative consequences, particularly the potential disappearance of deeply rooted traditions and the subsequent erosion of cultural identity. Therefore, a balance must be struck between embracing technological progress and preserving the invaluable aspects of our traditional cultures.'}]

We are constantly exposed to evidence of their lavish lifestyles, such as big houses, luxury cars, and yachts. This raises the question of whether this is beneficial or appropriate for our society.

They believe that these individuals have not made significant contributions to society compared to scientists, politicians, and doctors. While film stars and musicians may create art that enriches our spiritual lives, it is undeniable that we cannot survive solely on songs and films. These forms of art are valuable, but they should not create such a vast disparity in payment compared to other professions.

Although I may not personally favor this fact, the truth is that the exorbitant payment is a result of the attention we give to these entertainers. In our digital age, attention translates to money. This is the new reality of our society, and therefore, there is nothing inherently wrong with it. Furthermore, it is worth considering that many of us may not even be aware of the names of scientists or doctors until we require their services.\nIn conclusion, I believe that these entertainers deserve their astronomical salaries.

This is because they advocated all there time and effort to get the salary that they have today. Before they become famous, they only have few incomes or even get nothing. That is to say, many musicians did not get any payment at the begining of their career, so do the actors and sports players, they spent their time but do not get any money. For instance, before being a well-known musicians, they have to spend their own money on buying equipment to produce musics or to public the songs they have made.

I fully think that the benefits to have admission fees compensate the drawbacks to be not free.\nMany individuals would visit museum or art galleries if it were free which could attract more tourists. Unfortunately, admission charge decreases the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. However, before being a cultural place, art galleries are a place where numerous employees work. Indeed, if visitors had not to purchase the entrance, workforce would be not paid and the place would be not clean as museum should be.

He handed over the design of his office to the constructors feeling they won't do anything immature. 4 years later, however, when he went to see the final result of his much-awaited private office, he was completey bewildered by the sight. Instead of seeing a normal office-like building with normal cement on it's exterior, he saw that his dream office looked the exterior of a night club! Instead of normal cement, the exterior was built with transparent glass, and Mr. Deshmukh's name and designation, written in a florescent like way, was carved out on a 3 metre long glass slab!!\nComing to the people who believe the control of the design should go to the constructors/people who finance the building think so because they feel that not everything should be in the hands of the government. They also feel that since it was their initiative to get that building built, they should have the final say on how it should look like.\nWhen it comes to my opinion, i believe that the control of the design of the building should go to the person/people who first thought of getting it constructed, meaning the people hired architects and did the needful to get an ideal design of the building they want to construct.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay addresses the prompt adequately and provides arguments for both sides of the issue.

In my opinion, I believe these statement can be both true and false at the same time.\nMixture of nationalities may promote country's development as some particular nationalities are more proficient in one particular activity than another nationalities. For example, Jamaican has a superior body in running. They are the whipping out all the gold medals in running. Each nationalities has it's own strongness, so they can help each other to develop the country.\nOn the other hand, development in the country may not be fast when different nationalities are in one country due to the conflicts between the locals and the foreigners about culture and language differences. Such conflicts may rise and result in slower development as there are going to be communication difficulties between the local citizens and foreigners. In addition, local citizens may be annoyed of foreign people taking away their jobs, creating more anger between each other. To exemplify, USA is one of the country that has multinational population. USA has developed a lot over a past decade and is a leader of technology but at the same time, it contains many social issues such as race hatred. USA is expected to develop less compared to other countries for many reasons, but mainly due to intelligent and competitive foreign experts leaving their country.\nIn conclusion, I believe different nationalities will play a critical role in the country's development.

However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nAchieving success in any field requires dedication and perservance. Some people believe that only those who are naturally gifted can perfrom greatly in fields such as art and sport while others do not. This essay will discuss both views and illustrate why anyone through constant practise and hardwork can have a bright future in both of these fields, whether it was sports or art.\nHaving natural talent in art or sports is surely an advantage that could lead to accomplishments in the future. It puts the person levels above those who are not as fortunate as him or her. For instance, Lionel Messi, arguably the best player to ever kick a ball, is considered by many football fans the most talented play in history. According to Messi's coach, he is not the most dedicated player out of his teammates since he does not put in the same amount of effort as many others, but he certaintly yields the best results. Personally, whenever I see him play, I feel that there is a unvisible force of attraction, similar to a magnet, between his foot and the ball. There are many examples where people invested many hours of their day into learning art, but could not produce something of high quality. My sister, who is 26 years old, is actually one of those examples. She spent 2 hours a day for four years practising art, but she could not draw better than my cousin, who is 12 years and rarely does any drawing.\nOn the other hand, if someone is willing to put in the work and ready to face whatever it takes to reach the top, he or she will definitely do so, even if no natural is found. After all, certain skills are needed in any field, including sport and art, and by frequent training, those skills could easily be aquirred. One of my close friends was overweight and could not score a single goal in a 90-minute handball match. However, after multiple hours put into improving his technique and abilities, he became the best player in school; he was chosen by the coach as a captain to lead our team in a tournament.\nTo conclude, although having talent eases the path to success, it is not a requirment for others to do the same thing, if they put in enough effort and have commitment.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay addresses the prompt and provides a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.

It' is often argued that there are some benefits and drawbacks of this type of journey. I believe there are some drawbacks of this pursuit, but I see more benefits as it might allow researchers and especially travellers to explore natural ecosystem safely without destroying it.\nFirst of all remote travelling will give broad opportunities scientists to research more untouchable natural ecosystems. Those researches' results might play a crucial role to understand our nature well and therefore to take firm steps to protect it. For example, the growing researches showed, that after thourough exploration of the North and South Capes, scientists could finally understand the devastating effect of the Global warming, as researches revealed dramatically melting process of the glaciers. Though remote research might be base for some scientific breakthrough, however in some cases, it's important to be in a place personally to measure changes not only visually but also to take some lab examples.\nOn the other side, Web net based journey might be good alternative for those tourists who want to explore world but can't spend more money or resources on that journey. In this case remote journey is beneficial for both sides: for the natural environment which is staying safe from tourists' crowds interference, and for the tourists as well, as they shouldn't spend more resources on this kind of traveling. For instance, if person showing willingness to see the natural environment such as rainforest but can't travel, this type of the tourism might be the great chance. Though new technologies allow to see and even listen the natural environment voices whole, however real feelings and emotions of being for instance in the Southern Pole impossible to recieve when you are online.\nIn conclusion, there are some benefits and disadvantages of the remote traveling and research work that should be taken into consideration.

This phenomenon spurs the discussion about the underlying reasons, such as the detrimental influence of parents and other people acting improperly. This essay will explore the causes and impacts of extensive drug use among young people, and introduce plausible suggestions to address this issue.\nThe dominant cause of this problem is the publicity of pharmaceutical companies that exaggerating the efficacy of their products while playing down or concealing the side effects of such drugs, notably, the drugs that can alleviate the tiredness and improve the mood while risking addiction or even the loss of rationality. These drugs help teenagers a lot in terms of avoiding the sleepiness, especially in classes and lectures where they have to focus on the knowledge points expressed by teachers and lecturers. However, given the lack of information about the adverse effects involved, teenagers may gradually get addicted to such drugs. The other contributing factor is the absence of attention paid by parents who more often than not, have to deal with the tremendous workload so that they have little time spent with their children. The improper drug use exerts far-reaching impacts on teenagers and adolescents. The most notable effect in this regard is the deterioration of health conditions, both physically and mentally, as exemplified by the higher frequency of asthma and the worsening ability of socialising.\nTo tackle this problem, it is necessary for pharmacential corporations to clarify the pros and cons of their products, and for parents to spend more time with their children to identify potential hazards. I expect in the future, more suggestions could arise to solve the problem of drug abuse among young people.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Re-evaluated Essay:\n\nIn the modern society, there is a growing prevalence of drug misuse among young people, particularly adolescents and teenagers, who experiment with a range of drugs regardless of their legal status. This concerning trend has prompted discussions on the possible causes, including the negative influence of parents and other individuals who engage in improper drug use. This essay will examine the factors contributing to widespread drug use among young people and discuss the resulting effects, as well as propose recommendations to combat youth drug abuse.\n\nOne major cause of this issue is the extensive marketing strategies employed by pharmaceutical companies, which often exaggerate the benefits of their products while downplaying or concealing their adverse effects. Specifically, drugs that can alleviate fatigue and enhance mood are highlighted as beneficial, despite the risk of addiction or impairment of rationality. These drugs are often used by teenagers to combat sleepiness, particularly in demanding academic environments where they need to concentrate on the material presented by teachers or lecturers. However, due to the lack of information regarding potential drawbacks, teenagers may gradually develop a dependency on such drugs. Another contributing factor is the lack of attention from parents, who are often burdened with heavy workloads and consequently have limited time to spend with their children. This neglect further exacerbates the issue of improper drug use among young people.\n\nThe consequences of extensive drug use by young people are far-reaching, manifesting in both physical and mental health deterioration. For instance, an increased incidence of asthma has been observed among drug users, along with a decline in their socializing skills. These effects highlight the urgency of addressing the problem of youth drug abuse.\n\nTo tackle this issue, it is imperative for pharmaceutical corporations to provide accurate and transparent information regarding the benefits and risks associated with their products. Additionally, parents need to prioritize spending quality time with their children in order to identify and prevent potential hazards. Moreover, it is hoped that more recommendations will emerge in the future, aimed at effectively combating drug abuse among young people.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising prevalence of drug misuse among young people in modern society is a pressing issue. The causes of this phenomenon include misleading advertisements by pharmaceutical companies and lack of parental attention. The impacts of extensive drug use among young people are evident in the deterioration of both physical and mental health. To address this problem, it is crucial for pharmaceutical companies to provide accurate information about their products, while parents should prioritize spending time with their children to prevent drug abuse. There is a need for further suggestions and actions to effectively combat youth drug abuse. \n\nOverall, this revised essay effectively addresses the given prompt. It presents a clear introduction, develops coherent arguments with relevant examples, and offers recommendations supported by logical reasoning.

What are the subjects and the skills that children have to learn and what help them to grow up better? According to one view, art is vital for the growht of children and therefore it has to be a school subject. On the other hand, there are people who think that to do art at school is a waste of time. I believe that to study art is fundamental for at least two different factors and then it should be teached in the schools. Surely, more dignity should be deserved to it.\nTo study art at the different level of education is essential for the development of certain skills. First of all, those children who play with art develop the ability to measure, to structure a picture as well as delineate the border of a page earlier than those children who are not educated in drawing. They start recognising pictures and to distinguish between the colors and their possible mixtures. The second reason, by contrast, is linked with some psychological implications that to do art involves. To do art does not mean just to draw. Art can help adults to understand children and their needs. Children, thanks to the drawing activity, can start expressing their emotions and desire using pictures and colors. They can start working with their imagination before they learn the acquire the writing and reading skills. These two reasons lead some people to believe that is fundamental for children to do art. Then, art has to be a subject and considered as useful as Mathematics and English. The development of creativity and critical thinking that art implies is extraordinary useful. Indeed, children are led to understand practically what they have to do if they commit an error when they are drawing. They start to think about the errors they can made as possibility to do something new and original.\nBy contrast, there are people who dislike the idea that art can be compared to other subjects like Math and Science. They believe that art is more an hobby than something useful. Since there are no notions that a child can memorise and there are not test a teacher can prepare to understand the level of the children, art cannot be considered a subject. Therefore, there are no reasons to teach it in schools. However, the reasons presented by those who do not want to add art in the list of school subjects are misguided. They start from the idea that to learn means to stay hours in front of a book. This is obsiusly true but it is not enough. There is a fundamental part of learning that is advantaged by practical activities like art.\nIn conclusion, I believe that art is a subject and should be considered as such. The notions learnt by drawing are as essential as the first basis of grammar, keeping the necessary differences. Since children have to develop different skills, art as a school subject should be supported because it help children to develop at least creativity and critical reasoning as well as to express their emotions.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall comments:\nThis essay addresses the prompt and presents arguments for both sides of the argument.

In my opinion, since only art permits the develop of children's creativity, it has to be considered as important as the other school subjects such as science or history.\nIn 2018, it was conducted a research among 100 children in which only half of them were following art classes. The resulting outcome was mind-blowing: in fact, those which had the opportunity to learn more about art had develop their creative skills, while the others, athough some of them had a natural talent, had not made any improvement. Hence, the result has underlined the importance of this subject.\nOn the other hand, some people think that children use the hours of art in school only to have fun and play with colours. I believe that this is partly true; however, since children have the right to express theirselves, this time in which art is taught plays an important role in their education. For instance, many studies have underlined that children suffering from ADHD (a psychological issue that causes hyperactivity), since they are using their energies painting and creating sculptures, can be calmer thanks to art.\nIn conclusion, I believe that art has to be taken into consideration with the same importance given to the other subjects because it leads to several benefits for children and, for this reason, teachers have the duty to teach them art properly, thus permitting children to become artists one day.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'In terms of task achievement, the essay addresses the prompt by discussing both views on whether art is essential or a waste of time in schools.

In the last years people used to relying on the private car to move around. . Although the possible reasons that persuaded people to use private cars, the problems that rise from their excessive use, such us traffic and pollution, are harsh consequences to be accepted. I think that an improvement of public trasportation and to incentive the use of ecological means of trasport like bicycle should be possible solution to those issues.\nCars are considered the most confortable mean of trasport. In particular, if you have to move in a big cities like Milan. Indeed, means of trasports sometimes are late or full and also more unsafe. If you are a woman, for example, the use of public trasportation in some part of Italy is not safe mostly during the night hours. Another problem is that of comfort. If people use their car they can go whethever they want, when they want. If they have to spend more time in a place, they have not to be worried about the last bus they had to take to come back home.\nHowever, over-reliance of cars cause at least two big problmes: traffic and pollution. On the one hand, the problem of traffic will produce other issues such as anxiety and irritation. Indeed, if you have to go work in the morning and you live in a city like Rome you have to consider at least one hour spent in the traffic. Pollution is surely the most severe issue. Indeed, if all the people used to take a private car, then it is easely imaginable how much cars and fuel can be consumed daily. The two problems are linked, I want to underline, indeed, the noise pollution that derives from an intense traffic. It should be considered dangerous both for persons and animals.\nTwo possible solutions to the problem of the over-reliance on cars are the following. Firstly, public trasportation should be improved. Indeed, if bus and tram were more safe and more confortable, then people would be more tent by their use. At least, they will solve the problem of traffic. On the other hand, I see the echologycal means of transport like bycicle as the new border to pass in order to save the world from pollution. One possible suggestion would be that of make cheaper the bycicle and also to give an economic subsidy to those people who decide to help the planet using them.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the the use of private cars, because of the problems that it causes, should be discouraged.

Again, knowledge, tools, forms of producing, technology can help not only the eficiency in the economy but also the environment.

Some countries have wars, other ones donÃ‚Â´t even have organized governments. Other ones have organized governments and no wars but lack of basic needs such food, health and education.

Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nPoverty has been always a major issue around the world. Due to viruses, natural disasters, and poor management in the country and overpopulation, each day the poverty increases. In addition, some developed countries ignore the help or just give a temporary solution. Poverty has a great effect on the income that can lead to serious problems.\nTo begin with, developed countries shouldn't only support with financial aid, as that kind of solution will not help the people. In my opinion, rich countries can stop poverty in such way to look for the natural resources of the poor country and to help and develop its resources. For example, in Africa they are famous for their large area of land. A rich country can take this opportunity to implement a long-term plan to benefit and fight poverty, such as to start expanding the lands of agriculture to use their natural resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee. Furthermore, this idea can also help the people of the country where they can work on the land and be employed.\nAlso, developed countries can donate and build health care centers and schools to prevent the dangerous disease from spreading. Schools can empower children to grow up and help the country's economy to rise and to fight poverty.\nIn conclusion, developed countries can unite and discuss this significant concern rather than helping with financial support as poverty is taking the lives of many children.

Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to unprivileged countries rather than financial aid.\nI agree, for the most part, as we have seen from history, sadly the leaders of those countries aren't always thinking of helping their citizens with the money they got gifted. These world leaders could think of themselves first and satisfy themselves before they do anything else. Sometimes the world leaders don't help, after helping themselves they build their armies, and buy more weapons for more destruction. Before countries decide to help other countries with financial aid, they should analyze the world leader and see what type of world leader they could be. If the world leader shows any signs of selfishness, money won't help their citizens, it doesn't help with their situation at all. When the citizens find out their world leader isn't helping them with the financial aid, they could go violent and cause riots, revolutions, and a huge decrease in currency strength, which will increase poverty, homelessness, and famine.\nOn the other hand sending resources such as beverages, clothes, and books to help increase the number of educated people in the country would be far more useful. unfortunately, these types of countries have a problem with education among the citizens, many citizens want to educate themselves but aren't able to. Food and clothes help as well, many civilians don't have the privilege to warm themselves up, or get full. This will help with their quality of life.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'In terms of Task Achievement, the essay partially addresses the prompt.

But, others think youngsters who were taught to share and be corporative will turn into helpful adults.\nThe sense of competition indeed can generate excitement and can push youngsters to give their best. On the other hand, the competitive feeling can cause hatred among children, especially if the parents were pressuring their child to always take the lead. For example, when I was nine years old I used to have a friend in my class that had a great sense of competition. She often caused problems when she lose or answered wrong. Unfortunately, the teacher got to know with the encouragement of her parents the girl felt pressured and the fear of disappointing them. In addition, parents can teach their children to co-operate and to engage with other youngster, to motivate them and to help them learn how to share, which can become a great experience when they get older and be more understanding and considerate.\nHowever, a sense of competition is not always frustrating it can encourage a youngster to develop new behavior that can help them to discover adventurous journeys. Furthermore, being competitive among children might attract shy children to engage more and break the wall of fear.\nIn my opinion, teaching children to co-operate is far better than being competitive.

Some people hold that adolescents should be encouraged to compete, while others disagree and argue that teaching children to work together is more important. This essay will analyse both positions and illuminate my standpoint.\nAs for those highlighting the importance of competition, these people may have their position grounded upon the fact that children can learn a lot by competing against each other, especially when they encounter numerous obstacles brought by their strong opponents and suffer failures. Only under such adverse conditions can children understand their drawbacks and the ways of improvement. Apart from that, if children have hard-earned victories over competent rivals, they are likely to gain tremendous pleasure of success as well as huge confidence that motivates them to keep working diligently and achieve more success.\nOn the contrary, in terms of those attaching greater importance to cooperation than to competition, these people may justify their position by citing a large number of examples elucidating the role of collaboration in various tasks, such as the production of a high-tech gadget of which the parts are manufactured by different countries, and a formal meeting where people present their respective views on a given issue in order to comprehenively understand the situation. Admittedly, these examples sufficiently explain the importance of cooperation. However, this does not mean that cooperation must outweigh competition since the two ways of interaction influence us differently and it is rather impractical to identify which one is more influential to us.\nTo sum up, competition and cooperation benefit us in different ways.

On the other hand, there are those who suggest that leisure time is made to relax the mind. I believe that a balance between the two extreme views is the better solution.\nIt is very important to give to coltivate our mind with culture. Reading a book, listen to classical musing, play games in which problem solving tricks should be sold is a funny way to spend your time and at the same time exercise the brain. To spend 15 minutes playing a game in which you have to solve math problems or doing world puzzles can be considered as the mental counterpart of the physical workout. To read a book had always been considered as the best way to learn without studying. Another interesting way in which the brain should be trained is by playing an instruments. To focus on some activities that will encourage the development of your skills and more stimuli on your brain is surely one of the best way to spend a part of your leisure time.\nOn the other hand, it is also important to rest. Also your brain need a break. While it is easy to rest your body by sitting on the sofa it is not equally easy to stop your brain and to give to it a break. Listening to classical music, listening to the sounds of the nature, to have a nice walk, do meditations are some ways in which you can rest your mind. Even if it will be time in which the brain is on pause, some positive effect will be noted. Indeed, after only 30 minutues the brain will be recharged and full of energy.\nIn conclusion, I believe that a balance between intellectual activities and total rest of the brain will be the best solution to give to the mind both stimuli and time to recharge itself.

How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nIn the last years the problem of global warming is becaming more and more debated. One of the main causes of the temperature rising are men-made activities. Almost all the activities made by humans produce a huge impact on the natural environment. For instance, some of the usual activities made daily by people are impacting. Indeed, the chemical products they buy and use as well as the ways of trasportation's abuse can be annoverated among the main reasons for global warming. Lastly, even if it is the more impacting, there is the industral system and their production of slags.\nThe first impact made by men-activities concerns the product they use. There are at least three kinds of products that may cause the rising of temperature. First, there are products like lacquaer and foam. Because they were beed uncontrolled used during the last decades, they have been one of the main causes of the Ozone Hole. Spray products, even if they are just suncream or hair conditionars could be very impacting because of their chemical composition. Another men-activity that impact a lot on the environment concern their use of the way of transportation. Indeed, the abuse of private ways of trasportation caused an increasement of pollution and a dramatic increase of the level of petrol in the environment. Petrol is not only one of the main reason for global warming but also the first responsible for sea's pollution. Furthermore, the dayly use of flight cause pollution in the air and now restriction on the abuse of this way of trasportation are trying to be a kind of solution to the problem.\nLastly, one of the main causes of global temperatures higher is the industrial system. Indeed, they used to point to the cheaper solution to produce and eliminate the radioactive waste. The problem of a prodaction that does not take care of the environment pointed to use polluting products and machines. Furthermore, the industrial system point to produce more and more causing the waste of energy and raw materials. For instance, the fashion industry is one of the more pulluting in the world. It abuses of materials and energies whithout caring abuut the waste of them. Finally, the problem of the way in which the industries procede in elimnating waste is crucial. Indeed, in the last years they used to disperse the waste on the sea. This tendecy was increased for two reasosns: saving and speed. These are the two eassential words of industrial system.\nIn conclusion, I think there are two main reasons that cause the raising of global temperatures that can be annoverated among the others. Those that concern the personal and daily activities of men (use of determinate products and ways of trasportation) and then those activities operate by the industrial system.\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Evaluation according to IELTS writing criteria:\n\n1.

However, many ecologists point out that human activities have put a massive burden on the ecosystem, which leads to increasingly higher global temperatures. This essay will explain the major causes of global climate change, followed by several plausible solutions.\nIt has been widely recognized that excessive greenhouse gas emissions are the culprit of global climate change, and burning fossil fuels and consuming oil are the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions. First, our daily life in a modern society heavily relies on electricity, acquired mainly through burning fossil fuels like coal. A colossal amount of smoke, predominantly carbon dioxide, is released during this process. As a result, the smoke captures excessive heat on the Earth, resulting in an increase in global temperatures. Second, consuming oil impacts global temperatures in the same way. As the energy from burning fossil fuels cannot meet the rapidly growing needs, more and more oil extraction programs are set up to acquire petroleum. The process of both drilling oil and consuming it creates a significant amount of greenhouse gases. Thus, burning fossil fuels and consuming oil are significant causes of climate change.\nHowever, although lowering greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, several actions could decelerate the effect. One major step is to urge the energy-dependent companies to reduce productivity and create more jobs in green industries. Like large cloth manufacturers, giant companies need a significant portion of energy to keep their machines running every day. By reducing productivity, the amount of energy they need can drop. At the same time, the government should increase investment in green industries to maintain a healthy employment rate. On the other hand, individuals can make their own contribution by reducing their personal carbon footprints. Every small step, such as turning off the lights when leaving home, taking public transportations instead of driving cars, or simply eating less meat, can make big changes.\nIn conclusion, the excessive greenhouse gas emissions released mainly by burning fossil fuels and consuming oil have caused an alarming increase in global temperatures. Nevertheless, this problem could be alleviated by a collective effort of giant companies and individuals.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay meets the criteria for IELTS writing at a band 8.0 level.

The causes of making temperatures higher can be for various reason, but rencently there is a growing evidence that man-made activties are causing it. Man-made activites such as pollution can be one of the causes. Nowadays, we must focus on how we can deal with them and solbe the problem. This essay will include the causes and the solution on why our earth temperature is increasing.\nAt first, we are polluting the earth without realizing the threats or problems that this can cause in the future, that is because of the unawarness of our society. One of the main causes of the rising temperatures is factories. Factories production can cause severe air pollution, because of the burning waste or by blowing air that include chemicals out to the fresh air. The current rise of temperature is alarming. Deforestation is another reasons to this problem. Deforestation is caused by humans to sell it or use for our own benefit, but in reality we are killing planet earth.\nTo every problem there are solution. Since we are already in this problem; we better find a solution before it is too late. Even though there are man-made activites that are causing the problem, but there are some that can solve it. The introduction of electronic car is the beginning of the solution, where the use of diesel are decreased to make our vehicles more eco-friendly. As we can see today, restaurants and cafes are serving plastic straws; even though, this will not solve the problem immediately, but it is a good start to make our life more friendly to our environment.\nIn conclusion, global warming is a serious issue that must not be avoided.

175,629,"\nPrompt:\nMore people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nOver the past decades, it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age. There could be different reasons for this and I am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs, which will also explain why I believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages.\nApparently, the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years, sometimes without us even noticing it. The most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births. In fact, owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s. Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion.\nThe drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children. Admittedly, someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and, as a result, the issues of miscommunication that could arise.\nHowever, the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined. First of all, older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers; consequently, due to their broader life experience, they would arguably make better advisors for their kids. Not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs, but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children's further education, which in turn could help the latter having a better and well-paid job in the future.\nTo conclude, although it's impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age, the advantages still outrun the disadvantages. Thus, children would be the first to benefit from such a situation.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countriesÃ¢\x80\x99 economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates strong language proficiency and meets the criteria for a band 9.0 score.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nThe debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a monthÃ¢\x80\x99s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a familyÃ¢\x80\x99s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the familyÃ¢\x80\x99s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the propertyÃ¢\x80\x99s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Essay Evaluation:\n\n1.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nIt is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their livesÃ¢\x80\x99 necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus.

Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep oneÃ¢\x80\x99s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s lives being less influenced by their jobs today.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nTraditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a childÃ¢\x80\x99s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in todayÃ¢\x80\x99s world. BabiesÃ¢\x80\x99 milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Re-evaluation of the Essay:\n\nTask Achievement:\nThe essay clearly addresses the prompt by expressing the writer\'s opinion on whether men are suited to staying at home to care for children.

It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of todayÃ¢\x80\x99s society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Essay Evaluation:\n\n1.

Other people believe that more is learned from getting a job straight away after school and learning whilst working.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nThere are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by todayÃ¢\x80\x99s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need studentsÃ¢\x80\x99 full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nTodayÃ¢\x80\x99s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. PeopleÃ¢\x80\x99s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong understanding of the prompt and effectively presents a clear and well-supported argument.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nWith ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it wonÃ¢\x80\x99t also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacherÃ¢\x80\x99s and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacherÃ¢\x80\x99s specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them. In this way, students would receive the benefits of both ways of instruction.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the ownerÃ¢\x80\x99s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on oneÃ¢\x80\x99s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping oneÃ¢\x80\x99s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and oneÃ¢\x80\x99s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed ownerÃ¢\x80\x99s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employeeÃ¢\x80\x99s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed.

Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society. Finally, quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills.It seems to me that learning a foreign language, therefore, is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue. It is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in todayÃ¢\x80\x99s schools.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Criteria for evaluating the essay:\n1.

Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that canÃ¢\x80\x99t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a Ã¢\x80\x98virtual libraryÃ¢\x80\x99 as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Essay Evaluation:\n\nTask Achievement: Band 9.0\nThe essay fully addresses the prompt and provides a clear opinion on whether libraries with print books are necessary in today's society.

Governments have no obligation to provide this benefit.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nThe responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

What are the effects of this on individuals and society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nBanning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial.

190,656,"\nPrompt:\nMany schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nIt has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called Ã¢\x80\x98work experience placementsÃ¢\x80\x99. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I canÃ¢\x80\x99t see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students wonÃ¢\x80\x99t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a childÃ¢\x80\x99s entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the weekÃ¢\x80\x99s work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of Ã¢\x80\x98holidayÃ¢\x80\x99 away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

191,658,"\nPrompt:\nSome people believe that homework should not be given to school children. Others, however, say that homework is an important requirement for children to be able to develop appropriately. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nThe benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated. Some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school, whereas others feel that the more work set, the better.It is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children. The competition to do well, to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant. This has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development. The argument, however, that more is better is not always valid. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. When a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects, he or she is processing a lot of information already. To give more work to be done at home, therefore, would be pointless and even counterproductive. In addition to this, although it is important to be educated, childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time. Homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this.On the other hand, it can be argued that there is a place for homework. If study at school is not overdone, the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise. ItÃ¢\x80\x99s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once, but if that concept is revisited a second time, the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember.It seems to me that there is a place for homework for todayÃ¢\x80\x99s children. What must be remembered, though, is that homework needs to be limited to age-appropriate parameters, so that a balance can be struck between study and free time and relaxation.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""The essay addresses the prompt and discusses both views on whether homework should be given to school children.

What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nIt is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who donÃ¢\x80\x99t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in todayÃ¢\x80\x99s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Overall, the essay effectively addresses the prompt and provides a clear argument with relevant examples.

194,661,"\nPrompt:\nWith the scale of globalisation today, it would be of unquestioned benefit to have a single world currency.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nGlobalisation has become a significant aspect of the worldÃ¢\x80\x99s modern economy, with countless industries and businesses expanding in various countries. This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an Ã¢\x80\x9cunquestioned benefitÃ¢\x80\x9d. Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countriesÃ¢\x80\x99 economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well. For that reason, I feel that in present circumstances, it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nIn many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'The essay demonstrates a strong command of language and a clear structure, which are two important criteria for the IELTS Writing test.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nHomelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyoneÃ¢\x80\x99s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyoneÃ¢\x80\x99s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it. People need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and, although governments already have too many calls on their available funds, in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Essay evaluation based on IELTS criteria:\n\n1.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nThe amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay is well-written and effectively addresses the prompt.

Works by artists such as Picasso, da Vinci and Rembrandt have been sold for millions of dollars. Recently, a Modigliani was sold to a billionaire for one hundred and seventy million dollars. It certainly seems obscene that such figures are spent when many people around the world live in poverty.The work of many charities would be transformed by the money generated by just one of these art sales and in turn, the lives of ordinary people in need would be transformed. Medicines, food and shelter amongst other things could easily be provided, saving lots of lives, many of which would be children. When the issue is looked at from this point of view, the art sales world certainly seems obscene.However, in my opinion, things are unlikely to change. Human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth. Lots of prosperous people support many charities, but it is unlikely that they would completely relinquish their access to the luxuries that accompany their lives. The works of art are also often seen as investments in themselves, to be held on to for a period of time and then resold at a profit.In conclusion, in an ideal world, the vast sums of money that are spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need.

The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect todayÃ¢\x80\x99s societyÃ¢\x80\x99s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that todayÃ¢\x80\x99s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this.

Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'The essay provided exhibits strong language skills and effectively addresses the prompt.

Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a countryÃ¢\x80\x99s financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in todayÃ¢\x80\x99s world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators. This balance is important, as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects, the student will face problems later on in life.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the given prompt.

203,671,"\nPrompt:\nThere are many things that can motivate people to perform well in their work. These can include the salary, job satisfaction or the chance to help others. What do you feel is the best motivation to do well at work?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nTo perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Essay Re-evaluation:\n\nCriterion 1: Task Achievement (Band 9.0)\n\nThe essay fully addresses the prompt by discussing the various motivations for performing well at work, including salary, job satisfaction, and the opportunity to help others.

204,672,"\nPrompt:\nPublic health is becoming an urgent issue nowadays. Some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health, while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nEssay: \nPublic health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individualsÃ¢\x80\x99 right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as oneÃ¢\x80\x99s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

205,673,"\nPrompt:\nMore and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. Why is this happening? What measures can be taken to reverse this trend?\n\nEssay: \nAn alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their productsÃ¢\x80\x99 health benefits without fully understanding whatÃ¢\x80\x99s being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay deserves a band 8.0 on the IELTS writing criteria for the following reasons:\n\n1.

206,674,"\nPrompt:\nNowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. Some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. Do you agree or disagree?\n\nEssay: \nIt is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of todayÃ¢\x80\x99s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals arenÃ¢\x80\x99t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that societyÃ¢\x80\x99s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay addresses the prompt and presents a clear argument.

207,675,"\nPrompt:\nMany people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?\n\nEssay: \nMany people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from lifeÃ¢\x80\x99s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay addresses the prompt effectively and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic.

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?\n\nEssay: \nIn todayÃ¢\x80\x99s ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates proficient writing skills and effectively addresses the prompt.

209,677,"\nPrompt:\nEven though experts believe that walking is a great way to improve oneÃ¢\x80\x99s health, very few people walk nowadays. Why arenÃ¢\x80\x99t people walking? What can be done to encourage them to walk more?\n\nEssay: \nThe benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay addresses the prompt effectively and presents a clear argument.

210,678,"\nPrompt:\nIn many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?\n\nEssay: \nDespite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the Ã¢\x80\x98best byÃ¢\x80\x99 and Ã¢\x80\x98use byÃ¢\x80\x99 dates, thinking that foods that have passed their Ã¢\x80\x98best byÃ¢\x80\x99 dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget. The role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation.To conclude, the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world. It is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving, and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of language and addresses the prompt effectively.

211,679,"\nPrompt:\nNewspapers have a significant influence on peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative situation?\n\nEssay: \nMany people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think. There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers. It is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the prompt and effectively presents a well-structured argument.

212,680,"\nPrompt:\nSome people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?\n\nEssay: \nRaising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldnÃ¢\x80\x99t change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay deserves a band 8.0 based on the following criteria of IELTS writing:\n\n1.

213,681,"\nPrompt:\nDiscipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nEssay: \nWhile some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parentsÃ¢\x80\x99 shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their childÃ¢\x80\x99s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay meets the criteria for an IELTS Band 8.0.

214,682,"\nPrompt:\nThese days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?\n\nEssay: \nNowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the studentsÃ¢\x80\x99 dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay is well-written and addresses the prompt appropriately. However, to achieve a band 8.0, there are some areas that need improvement. Let\'s evaluate the essay based on the four criteria of IELTS writing: task achievement, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy.\n\n1.

Do the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages?\n\nEssay: \nInternational sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event arenÃ¢\x80\x99t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the countryÃ¢\x80\x99s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the countryÃ¢\x80\x99s economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised.

What can parents do to help their teenage children?\n\nEssay: \nYoung people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they donÃ¢\x80\x99t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other studentsÃ¢\x80\x99 work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmatesÃ¢\x80\x99 difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isnÃ¢\x80\x99t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay deserves a band 8.0 based on the following criteria:\n\n1.

217,687,"\nPrompt:\nCrime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?\n\nEssay: \nNowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons.

Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on studentsÃ¢\x80\x99 academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training.

The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position.

219,690,"\nPrompt:\nMany countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?\n\nEssay: \nIn the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong level of English proficiency and effectively addresses the prompt.

220,691,"\nPrompt:\nSome think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nEssay: \nChoosing a future career requires careful consideration. While some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, others oppose to that, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up. Given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs, I strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill oneÃ¢\x80\x99s potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests.The youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense. It is true that some professions, such as engineers or doctors, are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other, non-professional fields. For example, psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists; they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions. People who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about, that doesnÃ¢\x80\x99t pay well.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a Ã¢\x80\x98guaranteed futureÃ¢\x80\x99 is unrealistic. Even the smartest of us arenÃ¢\x80\x99t prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future; some high-salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults. Therefore, people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now, to avoid having regrets later in life.Having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over oneÃ¢\x80\x99s interests, I am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today.

221,694,"\nPrompt:\nIt is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nEssay: \nSome people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop oneÃ¢\x80\x99s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand oneÃ¢\x80\x99s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isnÃ¢\x80\x99t always easy because the viewerÃ¢\x80\x99s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong understanding of the prompt and presents well-reasoned arguments to support the writer\'s opinion. However, to achieve a band 8.0, there are several areas that could be improved.\n\n1. Task Response (Band 8.0):\nThe essay adequately addresses the prompt by discussing the advantages of reading for pleasure over watching television. The writer clearly states their opinion and supports it with relevant examples and explanations. However, to strengthen the task response, the writer could provide a counterargument or acknowledge the opposing viewpoint before refuting it. This would show a more comprehensive understanding of the topic and enhance the overall argumentation.\n\n2. Coherence and Cohesion (Band 7.0):\nThe essay is generally well-organized, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. The writer uses appropriate transitions to connect ideas within paragraphs (e.g., ""Furthermore,"" ""In contrast"").

The writer also uses academic vocabulary appropriately (e.g., ""convey,"" ""context""). However, to reach a band 8.0, the writer could further enhance their lexical resource by incorporating a wider variety of vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. Additionally, using more precise and specific vocabulary to convey ideas would strengthen the essay\'s overall impact.\n\n4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy (Band 8.0):\nThe essay showcases a high level of grammatical accuracy, with few errors. The majority of sentences are well-formed and demonstrate a good range of grammatical structures. However, to achieve a band 8.0, the writer could incorporate more complex sentence structures (e.g., conditional sentences, passive voice) to showcase a wider range of grammatical structures.

222,695,"\nPrompt:\nScientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nEssay: \nEnvironmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in todayÃ¢\x80\x99s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes.

223,698,"\nPrompt:\nÃ‚Â« Previous\n\nEssay: \nNowadays celebrities earn more money than politicians. What are the reasons for this? Is it a positive or negative development?Sample EssayNowadays celebrities make more money compared to people working in politics. This essay will look at the possible causes of this tendency and explain why, in my opinion, this is a negative development.There are two main reasons why celebrities generate more income than politicians. One of them is that with the advent of the Internet, there are more ways available for celebrities to earn money, such as online streaming services. For example, singing a song in a YouTube video with some advertisements enables them to easily make a few million dollars. Another cogent reason for this is the growing global concerns over excessively high remuneration for political leaders, which can easily lead to public discontent. In response to such criticism, many governments have decided to reform the reward system for lawmakers, sending their salaries on a downward trend.I personally believe that this development is relatively negative for several reasons, with the main one being the potential corruption scandals this issue can create. The enormous salary gap between celebrities and political leaders might discourage the legislators from putting in work or even motivate them to commit crimes such as money laundering. In addition, the relatively low salary for stressful jobs of governors may deter people with foresight on politics from becoming politicians. This is particularly undesirable because it would result in low level of citizensÃ¢\x80\x99 loyalty to their incompetent government, creating unstable society with more crime and other social problems.In conclusion, the fact that celebrities are paid more than political leaders now is caused by a wider variety of income sources available to them, and supported by the social norm that a politician should not be a profit driven professional. However, I believe this is a negative trend which may lead to more political corruption and less talented governments.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

224,704,"\nPrompt:\nMany people support animal testing while others believe it isnÃ¢\x80\x99t appropriate (discuss)\n\nEssay: \nMany people support use of animals for testing medicines for humans. Others believe it isnÃ¢\x80\x99t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isnÃ¢\x80\x99t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. WhatÃ¢\x80\x99s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others.

However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history.

Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way.

Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsIn todayÃ¢\x80\x99s world the number of traffic accidents is constantly rising as well as the number of injuries and deaths they cause. A better regulative approach is required traffic accidents can be reduced. Some people say that changing the driversÃ¢\x80\x99 age limits is the best solution to the problem. However, there are other, more practical ways to deal with this problem.One alternative is imposing heavier fines the drivers who exceed the permitted alcohol consumption. According to recent , a great proportion of traffic accidents has alcohol as its reason. Utilising technology and installing devices that detect drunk drivers and lock car ignition can be used to keep people with track record of drunk driving off the roads. On some occasions and for repeat offenders in particular, a prison sentence may also be considered.Furthermore, people should be better educated and more careful while behind the wheel. To be more specific, people should learn to obey road rules and respect the other drivers instead of causing tension or submitting to road rage. In addition, heavy fines should also be levied for exceeded speed limits. Last but not least, safer and wider roads should be constructed to make for easier and more comfortable driving.Tightening age limits for drivers can be a complementary approach. For example, the elderly with vision problems or other important health issues should be excluded from driving. Besides, young people under 18 years old are considered immature to drive. However, maturity does not necessarily always increases with oneÃ¢\x80\x99s age, which is why other measures are needed dangerous driving.In conclusion, I believe that stronger measures should be implemented for the prevention of traffic accidents, and drivers should have a more responsible attitude. Setting age limits could be helpful but should not be considered the optimal and only solution to the problem.The writerÃ¢\x80\x99s position is clear throughout the essay.

Do you think there are other measures that could be put in place? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?One of the most conspicuous trends of todayÃ¢\x80\x99s world is a colossal surge in the number of vehicle accidents cars, trucks and buses, all over the , be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that . In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.All the parts of the task have been covered fairly well.

Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children.

"," 'Overall, the essay addresses the prompt and provides a clear stance on the issue. However, there are some areas that need improvement in terms of coherence, grammar, and vocabulary.\n\n1. Task Achievement:\nThe essay agrees with the opinion that international sporting events can ease international tensions and release patriotic emotions. The writer supports this view by providing an example of South and North Korea participating in football games. However, the essay should also address the extent to which the writer agrees or disagrees with the opinion. Additionally, the essay could have provided more examples or evidence to support the arguments.\n\n2. Coherence and Cohesion:\nThe essay lacks coherence and cohesion due to the lack of clear paragraph structure and transition phrases.

Clear topic sentences and linking words/phrases would have helped to improve the overall flow and structure of the essay.\n\n3. Lexical Resource:\nThe vocabulary used in the essay is generally appropriate, but there are some errors and awkward phrasing present. For example, the phrase ""two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity"" could be improved by using more precise language. Additionally, there are instances of incorrect word choice, such as ""troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly"". A better word choice would be ""consequences"".\n\n4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy:\nThere are numerous grammatical errors throughout the essay, including incorrect verb tense usage, subject-verb agreement issues, and sentence structure errors. For example, the sentence ""In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers"" should be revised to ""In the midst of the football match, North Korean supporters came to South Korea with their footballers."" These errors negatively impact the clarity and accuracy of the essay.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, I would suggest a band score of 5 for this essay.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nEssay: \nFull time study in university is a great experience in life but in parallel to that students other activities such as working for their pocket money, sports, participating in debates and . People differ in their opinion if students must in other things or stay concentrated on their studies only. The discussion will be presented below, followed by my opinion.Some people say that mere studying does not youth for a country. This way, students only earn theoretical knowledge not practical. For instance, students can be their studies but at the same time when they , they fail and cannot develop their confidence and work as brilliantly as they were in university. Hence, the best approach for them to be engaged here and there for practical experience.On the other hand, others believe that building a better career is the foremost thing in todayÃ¢\x80\x99s world. So, they are targeted to their studies and gain as much knowledge as they can.

It refreshes studentsÃ¢\x80\x99 minds and provides more energy . Moreover, by this way, they will learn how to with other people in the society.To summarize, it can be said that it is important to concentrate on but on the other hand there must be something to keep active and relaxed being involved in games, music, work and other extra activities.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Full-time university students spend the majority of their time studying. Some argue that students should also engage in other activities, while others believe that focusing solely on their studies is more important. In my opinion, a balanced approach that includes both full-time education and extracurricular activities is necessary for students to develop practical skills, maintain mental well-being, and interact effectively with others.\n\nOn one hand, those who support the idea of students participating in various activities argue that solely focusing on studying limits practical knowledge. By engaging in other activities such as part-time jobs or sports, students can gain valuable real-world experience and enhance their confidence. For instance, a student who only focuses on studying may lack the ability to apply theoretical knowledge in practical situations, making them less effective in the workplace after graduation. Therefore, diversifying their experiences can help them develop practical skills and prepare for future challenges.\n\nOn the other hand, there are those who believe that academic success should be the top priority for students in today's competitive world. They argue that diverting attention away from studies may hinder their academic achievements. Students who dedicate all their time to studying are more likely to acquire a deeper understanding of their subjects and perform better academically. Additionally, maintaining a single-minded focus allows them to fully utilize their intellectual capacities, enhancing their chances of securing a successful career in their chosen field.\n\nIn my view, striking a balance between full-time education and extracurricular activities is essential. Engaging in activities beyond studying not only refreshes the mind but also provides students with additional energy and motivation to excel academically. Furthermore, participating in extracurricular activities allows students to develop essential life skills such as time management, teamwork, and communication. These skills are crucial for success both in personal and professional life. By interacting with a diverse range of individuals through extracurricular activities, students learn how to adapt to different social situations and build strong relationships in society.\n\nTo conclude, while it is important for full-time university students to concentrate on their studies, it is equally important for them to participate in extracurricular activities. This balanced approach enables students to acquire practical skills, maintain mental well-being, and effectively interact with others. Therefore, universities should encourage and provide opportunities for students to engage in a variety of activities alongside their academic pursuits.""}]

Some argue that financial education should be made compulsory in schools. This essay will discuss the extent to which I agree with this statement.\n\nOne common issue among young people is their lack of knowledge on how to manage money effectively. Advertisements often promote unrealistic financial expectations, such as ""Only 10 dollars a week, no deposits,"" leading them to believe that living in debt is normal. Financial education aims to address this problem by teaching young individuals how to use money wisely and evaluate the risks associated with borrowing for future purchases.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider other factors as well.

Therefore, parental involvement and guidance in financial matters cannot be ignored.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth considering the potential negative impact of financial education on students\' social lives. If financial education were to become a mandatory subject, students may become overly preoccupied with money, discussing it constantly in class or even in public. This fixation on financial matters could be detrimental to their social interactions and overall well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that financial education can have a positive impact on young individuals.

284,51,"\nPrompt:\nThe advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nEssay: \nThere is currently a contentious argument that using English as an international language will always have more benefits than drawbacks. Despite the use of English, which has been spreading globally, has positive effects on communication in various aspects, I personally believe that the disadvantages of the spread of English will eventually be more significant.\nIt is true that when more and more countries use English as a common language, the advantages of this implementation will outweigh its negative consequences. A classic example of this is that people from any country could communicate to each other in the easier way. This is because there will be no language barrier, preventing people to deliver their messages to others. Furthermore, using English globally tend to have less misunderstanding when communicating. This is exemplified by natives who live in the same country and speak the same language. These people can understand what each other say completely. Therefore, in terms of global perspective, if everyone has conversations in English, misleading communication tend to be less occurred.\nIn spite of the aforementioned positive consequences of the growing use of English, there are also potential drawbacks. A common example of this is the missing of some languages. Languages which are only used by small groups of people tend to fade away due to the fact that the majority of people would pay more attention to English without conserving these languages. In addition, nations that do not apply English as an international language tend to have small global economic growth. This is because most countries in international markets can understand English. Hence, countries whose people are unable to apply English could inevitably have less opportunities to make commercial deals with other countries, having the ability to speak English.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that the spread of English positively affects the way people from different countries communicate to each other and significantly decreases inaccurate information in conversations. Nevertheless, as this development can lead to the lost in other languages and the declining economy of some countries, I totally disagree with the notion that the advantages of the increasing popularity of English will continue to outweigh the disadvantages. This is because I personally think that the aforementioned negative impacts are the two most crucial aspects when using English.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay demonstrates a good command of English and effectively addresses the topic.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nEssay: \nSince the middle of the 19th century, English is recognized as the most important language and world common language. There is a variety of advantages because the number of English speakers, including non-native speakers has been increasing across the globe. I strongly agree with this phenomenon.\nTo go into detail, European countries, such as Switzerland, and Belgium are configured with some languages in one country, such as German, French, and Italian. Therefore, English is categorized as a common language in these countries. In addition, the US and European countries have been leading in a variety of fields, such as science, technology, and academic topics. Therefore, some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and north European countries followed learning English to keep up with technology. Therefore, the number of non-native speakers has widely and drastically increased in Europe to communicate smoothly. As a result, since internet technology has widely spread around the world, Japanese people can search for any kind of information in English more than five times higher than searching for the same information in Japanese. Therefore, learning English is inevitable for Japanese people, as well as other Asian countries or developing countries.\nFortunately, thanks to recent technology, it is getting easier to study English. For example, online English lessons, such as Cambly allows us to learn English 24/7. In addition, in some social media, the name of an app ""Club House"" is a convenient app to have a conversation with the same users worldwide. Therefore, we can easily share cultural differences and tips to improve our English skill.\nIn contrast, some people are concerned about their own native language might be vanished in the future. In Iceland, although there is a native language, ""Icelandish"" language still remains and is spoken in Iceland, but some people are anxious the language\'s complex grammar and vocabulary are difficult to explain in some detail. According to the researcher, they are astonished young students are all hanging out only in English, instead of Icelandish. Therefore, the government has been making an effort to maintain the native language by taking advantage of national Media such as, podcast, radio, TV broadcast are only spoken in Icelandish language.\nFinally, thanks to English language, more people are willing to communicate with a lot of people who speak English. This phenomenon is not only convenient to understand cultural differences, but also helpful to learn a variety of subject in English for developing countries, like in the Philipinnes.

Humankind is built on the foundation of risk-takers who not only achieved their goals of making the world a better place but also learnt to ability to get back up after their countless failures.\nSecondly, by not taking the chance provided and taking a risk, they are missing out on amazing opportunities that could never be achieved unless you have the confidence, determination and conviction to follow the unknown path ahead. These opportunities could easily get them ahead in life, and they would never come true unless they stroll out of their conform zone.\nAlthought that is the case, it is undeniable that the amount of risk for professional and personal lives is vastly different. If they fail in their personal life, this could hurt in the short term, for example, you could need financial support if you had a family feud. This short-term loss could be a disadvantage in life, but it may not be as crucial as its effect on professional lives, for example, a career change could involve a big pay cut, which could be quite influential on professional lives.\nOverall, taking risks could turn out to be a loss in the short term, but it is greatly outweighed by all the upsides taking a risk could bring.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""This essay has some strong points that contribute to its overall coherence and organization.

And all of them are of particular importance.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Re-evaluated Essay:\n\nThe economic progress, defined as the increase in a society's ability to produce higher valued goods and services using the same or equivalent resources, is considered by many governments as their primary goal. However, some individuals argue that other forms of progress are just as crucial for a country. This essay will discuss both perspectives and present my own opinion.\n\nEconomic growth brings several advantages, including higher average incomes and improved standards of living. As a result of economic progress, consumers are able to afford more goods and services, leading to a better quality of life. Moreover, a strong economy leads to job creation, high employment rates, and increased salaries for all citizens. Furthermore, economic progress provides governments with more funds to invest in infrastructure and public services. For instance, a thriving economy enables governments to build better transportation systems or enhance healthcare facilities.\n\nWhile economic progress is undeniably vital, I believe that technological progress is equally important for a country. Technological advancements refer to the discovery of new and improved methods of producing goods. Process technology, for example, plays a crucial role in refining raw materials like crude oil. Furthermore, technological innovations have significant military implications, as possessing advanced weapons is crucial for national security and war preparedness. On a more personal level, technological progress enhances daily life through the use of modern devices and networks such as 5G, improving communication and connectivity.\n\nIn addition to economic and technological progress, other types of progress, such as industrial, architectural, commercial, and civilization progress, should not be overlooked. These different forms of progress are interconnected and mutually beneficial in their own ways. For example, industrial progress relies on technological advancements and economic growth to increase productivity and efficiency. Similarly, architectural progress relies on economic prosperity to invest in innovative infrastructure and public spaces. Commercial progress, on the other hand, depends on technological advancements and economic stability to foster thriving businesses and trade. Lastly, civilization progress encompasses various aspects of societal development, including education, healthcare, and cultural enrichment.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic progress is undoubtedly crucial, I contend that other types of progress, such as technological advancements and societal development, are equally important for a country. These different forms of progress are interconnected and mutually supportive, contributing to the overall growth and well-being of a nation. Therefore, governments should strive to achieve a balanced approach that promotes various types of progress to ensure comprehensive development. (Words: 312)""}]

In my opinion, I believe that apart from economy, government should also consider other types of progress which also consider other types of progress which give equal importance to a nation.\nfirst of all, it is widely believed that increase in gross domestic product is related to economic growth, which governments also think is their main aim to focus on. This in other terms lead to an good export and import trading. For example, an imported product is more expensive when compared with native product in terms of quality and manufacturing, where more money is invested by government. Therfore, governments main focus shouldn't be only on economy.\nDesipte this, on the other hand,many argue that governments should also think about considering other types of progress which are as equal as economic progress. for instance, many countries are being recognized because of their education status and culture which attracts young stars to travel and study which in other terms also increase GDP. Other important factor is sports, by participating in worldcups, and olympics will also make a valuable progress by being recognized world-wide may lead to many opportunities. As a reason, the country's government should also focus more on other factors leading to progress.\nIn conclusion, I believe that government should not solely goal for economic growth but also concentrate on other factors which are equally important for a country's growth.\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Essay Evaluation:\n\nCriteria 1: Task Achievement - Band 5\n\nThe essay partially addresses the task by discussing both views and giving the writer's own opinion.

However, when it comes to whether living in a metropolis would do bad to peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s health, individuals hold different views. As far as I am concerned, it does diminish individualsÃ¢\x80\x99 health conditions.\nUndoubtedly, living in a metropolis has some benefits for the inhabitantsÃ¢\x80\x99 health. A big city is more likely to provide individuals with high level medical services which can be helpful when people are afflicted with various diseases. Precisely, there are numerous community clinics as well as large hospitals where individuals can get access to offering people the most advanced medical technology and medicines. Thus, greater recovering possibilities are provided by big cities for sick people.\nHowever, urban life can also be unhealthy due to numerous reasons. Firstly, individuals tend to suffer from greater mental stress in a metropolis. Specifically, the increasingly higher housing price contributes to the heavy financial burdens of individuals. People are compelled to struggle with high-intensity works due to the high cost in housing, which would cause a high mental pressure. Besides, one of the reasons for individualsÃ¢\x80\x99 mental pressure can be the indifferent relationship among urban inhabitants which is caused by the lack of a sense of community.\nFurthermore, the poor air condition which is caused by the remorseless rush of pollution in big cities does do harm to citizensÃ¢\x80\x99 health conditions. For instance, the waste gas that discharged by the cars in the streets and the factories is polluting the air in urban areas, leading to a higher rate in diseases. As a result, citizensÃ¢\x80\x99 health conditions can be diminished physically.\nIn conclusion, although a metropolis can provide advanced medical services to urban inhabitants, living in big cities can also be hazardous to individualsÃ¢\x80\x99 mental heath and body health due to numerous factors. In my opinion, living in a metropolis is more likely to undermine peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s health.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a good level of English proficiency and addresses the prompt effectively.

In this essay, I will be describing my total agreement with this dilemma.\nThe utmost reason for learning new language instead of using various programs is that human brain makes necessary changes in its structure and produces necessary chemical substances which in turn gives other functions to the brain. As a result of this human brain gains new functions in addition to the language skills.\nAnother benefit coming from directly learning language is the opportunity to express your beliefs and emotions in that language which is impossible to realize via software programs. People around the speaker tend to understand the spoken language more easily and get the speaker's ultimate goal in a more usual and humane way.\nThe third reason for studying the language rather than carrying a software to translate might be the possibility of immediately using language. In other words, software programs can not find the right words according to the situations or conversations among people. As a consequence of this, due to different meanings which translation devices remain useless in such cases, huge misunderstandings can occur.\nIn a conclusion, in addition to the reasons mentioned above, using language by learning it always seems realiable and more realistic way than using device for this purpose. As I raised my pure opinion toward gaining language skill earlier I strongly believe that this method has been the most preferable method for decades and it will be.\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay addresses the prompt and provides reasons for why learning a language is advantageous despite the availability of translation software.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nIn reality, translation softwares makes a lot of people\'s lives easier when communicating with others that don\'t speak the same language. However, in my opinion, learning a new language might be more advantageous than using this software.\nFirst of all, the process of learning new languages involves the ability to correspond words in two different dialects, which also requires using a lot of parts of our brain. Therefore, this process improves certain areas of our neurologic system, specifically, the left hemisphere, responsible for communication and speech.\nIn fact, multiple studies have shown that people that speak different idioms have a lower risk of neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer\'s and Dementia since the left side of the brain is more developed than others that might only know one language.\nFurthermore, these types of software are not always accurate. In spite of being correct the majority of the time, there are some situations where the translation is wrong because of different factors.\nOne of them is that there\'s no translation for certain words in other languages, for example, ""Saudade"" in Portuguese has no correspondence in English.\nBesides that, when using Google Translate one has to pay attention to the translation given in certain languages. In reality, when translating from English to Portuguese, sometimes the programme doesn\'t consider the fact that in Portuguese adjectives come after the noun while in English they came before.\nLastly, someone that chooses to use this type of system to communicate with someone, instead of learning that language loses a bigger amount of time than others that already speak that dialect. That is because one has to first record what the person is saying then tell the software their answer and wait for it to be translated to the other. This results in a quite complicated setting that might be aggravated in situations where the translator doesn\'t understand one of the persons involved in the conversation.\nTo illustrate this, when talking to the AI ""Siri"" on the iPhone or ""Alexa"" on Google, a lot of the time they don\'t comprehend what we are saying, which results in people having to repeat themselves several times.\nIn conclusion, I believe that learning a new language is easier than using a translation software. In fact, this not only boosts our knowledge but also avoids difficult situations where what people are trying to say is wrongly translated.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Essay Evaluation:\n\nCriterion 1: Task Achievement\nThe essay adequately addresses the prompt, providing reasons and examples to support the writer's opinion.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nNowadays, people hold different ideas about how to distribute students at schools. Some individuals argue that minors should be taught separately based on their academic performance, whereas others state that they ought to be educated together. This essay will discuss both viewpoints, although it is my opinion that it is better to allocate students together regardless of their capabilities.\nProponents of the idea of dividing children at different levels argue that the selection can better facilitate an efficient and productive learning environment for different students. More specifically, by doing so, schools can provide specific objectives to meet studentsÃ¢\x80\x99 needs as young people have distinctiveness in learning preferences, personalities, and interests. Therefore, through selecting and separating the youth into a range of classes based on their talents and intelligence, schools cannot only tailor a result-oriented syllabus to explore each studentÃ¢\x80\x99s maximum potential but also improve the quality of education since excellent students can learn in a fast way without anyone being left behind. In contrast, ordinary students can still keep up with the majority with complete comprehension. Furthermore, this can also minimise the possible pressure that some academically challenged students suffer from the negative psychological impacts, considering their poor performance in the exams or assignments.\nOthers, however, who point out that mixed classes attach great importance to the contribution of healthy competition and collaboration, also make valid arguments. Despite the possible imbalance in each studentÃ¢\x80\x99s academic performance in a class, superior peers can serve as a desirable role models to others. Their strengths, such as learning attitudes and methods, can enlighten the rest of the class to improve and study. In addition, the diversity in class can promote mutual study among children with different abilities and create a better environment for childrenÃ¢\x80\x99s all-rounded development. Since the way of streaming students has been proven effective and practical, this mode of teaching is highly advisable by educational experts, and there are still many schools following this norm to educate children rather than set them apart as many students who are not excellent at study may experience disappointment and a lack of confidence when compared to those straight-A students in separated classrooms.\nIn conclusion, although the teaching resources can be assigned more precisely to target youngstersÃ¢\x80\x99 gifts in the streaming, it is still too early and unfair at this stage. Therefore, I believe it is better to mix students with different levels of abilities in a dynamic and harmonious class, and undoubtedly, we should never discriminate unfairly against students who should be highly encouraged instead.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""This essay meets the criteria for an IELTS band 8.0 in the following ways:\n\n1.

Although some people believe that homeschooling is the best teaching method for the developement of children, most people are of the opinion that it is essential for children to go to school.\nThe most popular of the two opinons is that it is important for children to attend school. The main reason that people believe this, is because socialization with other children in school is viewed as being essential for the cognitive and social developement of children. The advantages of children attending school therefore consists of an improved social life with more friends their own age. This can help young children figure out how to navigate social situations better and improve their own self-image by receiving confirmation from their peers. Although there are a lot of advantages for children attending school, there are also a lot of disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that children don't get to spend a lot of time with their family. This can decrease the influence that parents have on their children in the long term and inable their ability to raise their children according to their own values.\nThe other less popular opinion is that it is better to teach your children at home rather than to send them off to school. The main reason that some people believe this, is because these parents are concerned that outside influences have the ability to disturb their childrens upbringing. The greatest advantage of homeschooling is that it promotes a better nuclear family and provides parents with more control concerning their childs upbringing. However, this schooling method comes with some disadvantages too, since childrens social developement can be hindered due to inatequate social interactions with children their own age.\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is best for childrens developement to be taught at school, rather than parents teaching their children at home.

It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.\nSecondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish.

It is true that nowadays almost everything is somehow connected to money, but I still believe there are some exceptions.\nThe reason why I agree with this statement is because society today is built up on finance resources. People somehow believe that if you do not have expensive things or an amazing car you are below them. Since money is the merit of a popularity and a good life, many people are remaining in the same job if they are going to be promoted or they are going to receive a pay raise soon, even though coworkers are poisonous and bad for their mental health. For example, it is easier to stay in their position with good money and bad colleagues than to change their job and try to make their way up again.\nOn the other hand, a lot of youngsters will probably choose the good working environment and nice group of people with who they will be working with, before a long payroll. Of course, it is pleasant to receive a huge amount of money every month but, if you will be working with people who are rude and annoying, you will be out of energy soon and moreover your workforce will be lower as same as your payment in the end.\nIn conclusion, I mostly agree with this averment because money is the great motivation for people, but I would also like to point up the importance of a great working group as it is another reason why to choose to stay where you are.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates adequate control of language and organization, but there are areas for improvement in order to achieve a higher band score. \n\n1.

From my perspective, although asking customers take this action is reasonable, I strongly hold that these service providers should play a more important role in this issue.\nOn the one hand, the reason why some people think customers should have more duties is that it ia driven by their demand. To be more specific, this is because they choose to buy some things with good packaging. But these goods are usually over packaged. Hence, if they reduce their demands for such products, producers and sellers naturally stop over package them to avoid a reduction in their busidness profits. For example, more and more people are persuaded to simply use a piece of paper to wrap the gift box instead of using a large number decorations.\nOn the other hand, they think it is driven by merchants as they have more control on it. Specifically, in order to sell goods better, they uauslly regard packaging as a tool to attract purchasers. In addition, if their competitors find it does help the sale of products, it also promote the competition on the packaging, which can further lead to excessive packaging. Take fast food for example, it is obviously that sometimes using just one bag can fit all food, but to gain a greater advantage over the competition, they may use a box or more to wrap them, and then, it creates a vicious cycle of over-packaging.\nIn conclusion, even though customers can help to solve this case, I believe manufacturers and supermarkets should take the main responsibility to reduce over-packaged goods, becasue if all sellers are competiting on it, customers will have no choices.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Essay Re-evaluation:\n\nOverall, this essay touches on the main points of the prompt and presents two opposing views on the responsibility for reducing packaging.

People rely on most transport type must be cars around the world, even in developing countries. In addition, recent cars released in a few decades tend to be durable and the most of energy is petrol which resource is made of fossil fuel. This means that cars emit carbon dioxide across the globe and the highest volume of carbon dioxide is considered by cars. Therefore, the majority of fact about global warming is caused by cars and airplanes.\nRecently, the car industry has become aware of this issue and they are starting manufacturing cars that never emit carbon dioxide. For example, some companies, especially Tesla, and Porsche had already released cars that consume energy as electricity, instead of petrol. This effort will cause a drastic reduction of transmitting carbon dioxide and some countries are planning to regulate laws all cars have to consume energy only by electricity.\nFinally, of course, there are other issues that lead to harmful environments around the world, such as deforestation, disposal of rubbish by incineration, and agriculture. For example, growing cows too much will generate methane gas which also relates to global warming. However, there is no doubt the total volume of the environmental problem must be cars; and other vehicles.

This, in turn, has grown into an environmental issue of global concern that governments across the world believe can be mitigated by adding on to the price of fuels. I chiefly disagree with the effectiveness of this method as next to nothing had been altered since the policy enforcement due to convenience issues.\nThe number of cars utilizing fuel has not dwindled. Even though many alternatives had been suggested, there was no mass production of transportation units for the use of average salary workers. The middle crust of society does not possess sufficient income to shift to environmentally friendly solutions for the fear of maintenance hardships. For instance, an electrical car would necessitate a spacious charging spot in front of a garage that not many possess. As a consequence, the more convenient and trustworthy solution to buy fuel is resorted to.\nThe population of the world as a whole does not stay in one place. As more and more people are born, there is a growing need for transport to be manufactured in a short span of time. Although a part of the population may be able to abandon their cars in exchange for bikes or buses, a significant portion of the growing society still opts for refueling cars in gas stations to get to places faster.\nIn conclusion, while the idea of the price policy introduction bore few fruits, they had not been enough to make a contribution to solving the carbon footprint.

The key contributor to informal writing is technological innovation. For instance, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram allow people to send texts to each other anywhere and anytime just by connecting to the internet.\nFurthermore, the texting culture of using abbreviated phrases has grown increasingly prevalent. As a result, applying casual language in written form has become more popular, and this substantially affects the written language.\nI believe that this trend may carry a certain degree of risk. Firstly, when using written language in an easier going way many times, people can forget how to write a formal letter. In fact, the current generation gets used to texting, so the young are not aware of how to write a formal email to apply for a job. Instead, they write these emails like they are texting with friends.\nSecondly, informal writing can adversely affect the academic performance of students. The students tend to utilize abbreviated words or slang in essays and assignments that require a greater level of formality.\nOne evident benefit to having more informal written communication in our professional lives is that it is less time-consuming. For instance, busy individuals working on the same task can share information instantly through a quick chat, rather than write a long and formal mail chain that requires thoughtful editing and proofreading.\nIn conclusion, although there are disadvantages to using informal words in written language, there are also attractive advantages.

Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nNowadays, written language is used in comparatively more informal and relaxed way. I assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. Without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. This option is essential in a modern temp of life. This essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.\nThe less formal and tense written language provides some pros. First of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. Then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. Moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. Then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.\nOn the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. Firstly, communication goes less respectful. Then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. Formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. Secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. In these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features.

For instance, buffets are the most commonly wasted tons of food, especially in the hotel. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.\nA solution to this worrying problem is to take away the leftovers back home. As food can be kept for a few days in the refrigerator, people can cook it at their house without going out to afford meals. As a result, this can reduce the expenditure on food and transportation. In my experience, my mother would pack the leftover food and bring it back home. As a result, the food still tastes the same at the restaurant. Thus, my family and I will never discuss what to eat for the rest of the day. Had it not been for preventing food waste by bringing it back home, the amount of waste foods would never have been able to reduce.\nIn conclusion, one of the main problems with the over-wasting of food in many countries is unable to finish the food and this can be solved by taking away the food back home. It is predicted that more and more individuals will be taking away their remaining food to their accommodation and this will reduce the amount of waste food.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay addresses the prompt and provides relevant examples.

What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nLiving in the 21st Century, it is without doubt that most of us already possess the luxury of having everything we need such as shelter, clothes and most importantly food and water. Despite this, it is sad to say that there are still a handful of the world's population that remain in the depths of poverty. And even so, many countries are found guilty to wasting huge amounts of food. In this essay, I will discuss the reason behind this food wastage and suggest solutions to reduce this effect.\nFirst and foremost, why do people waste food? It is to my belief that people tend to take more food than they can handle, especially at functions like all-you-can-eat buffets alongside weddings which act as a few of the many major contributers of food waste. In general, there is also the lack of awareness on poverty among the public to blame for. Therefore, people cannot practice consideration towards a cause they are unfamilar or unaware of. Other than that, they lack exposure to knowledge on the impact that food waste can bring to the environment and the society.\nNow, what actions can we take to reduce amount of food disposed? The government and country's leaders should take the first step in conducting educational campaigns on food wastes and poverty, particularly targeting school children and the public. This can play a significant role in shedding light onto the issues that need to be addressed urgently. People should also be strongly encouraged to take a more sensible amount of food before coming back for seconds to avoid the unecessary wastage as well as the excess weight gain.\nTo sum up, food wastage is not something to be proud of because of the all the adverse effects brought upon us, humans. Hence, we should quickly make the much needed change to help to turn this situation around and hopefully contribute to creating a better society.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'The essay response adequately addresses the prompt and provides a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.

327,162,"\nPrompt:\nWrite about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nIt is true that gender equality has achieved significant advancements nowadays compared to society in the past, and women have no doubt obtained more opportunities to get engaged in the leading role on many occasions. With regard to many success stories about female leadership, there is a common statement that women are more suited to be leaders. In my opinion, leadership depends more on ability rather than gender.\nThere are several reasons why some people may consider females as the better choice to occupy the leading position. Firstly, female leadership is a relatively new trend in recent decades with the development of society and therefore has been put under the highlight. In the past, men were always seen as the superior gender to run the company and dominate the realm. At the same time, women were seldom taken into account to be qualified to do management, and in many cases, they were merely not eligible for leadership. Hence, the opportunity and success of female leadership nowadays are highly emphasized and kept firmly in peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s minds, which probably leads to the imagination that women can better lead. Secondly, the statement can sometimes be regarded as propaganda for gender equality. In order to improve public awareness of the female role in leadership and create more chances for women to partake in leading, it is surely an excellent idea to set a good image of female leadership by advocating their merits. However, the decisive factors to successful leadership, which include capacities like communication, personal charisma, and intelligence, should not be misinformed.\nDespite the argument given above, I also believe that it is urgent to replace the stereotype of gender among the public, which contributes to the distinct impression of each gender about leadership. The male characteristics were traditionally defined as braveness, intelligence, and dominance, which match the requirement of leadership a lot. It is no doubt that women can be brave and able to take risks and responsibility in the leading position as well. A prime example can be female chancellor Merkel of Germany, who led the German government for more than 16 years and enjoyed a well-known reputation worldwide. Her political legend reflects the fact that the extraordinary competence of leadership does not exclusively belong to males.\nIn conclusion, although I completely agree that gender equality is of unparalleled importance. However, the key to successful leadership should never be related to gender.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

Nevertheless in the last decade the celebrations have started to look like something aimed to show how much money you have or you can spend. For example 30 years ago a communion celebration was a familiar meeting, going first to the church and celebrating it afterwards at home or at a restaurant with the closest members of your family. This is about to disappear.

The same happens with birthday parties, it seems to be a need of improving them each year, so parents struggle to find a more original idea year by year.\nOn one side it is understandable, it is a human desire to celebrate family events as much as possible. I can see the point of organizing a special event for the kids in their special days (if we stick to the communion or birthay party examples). We all wish to make these days unforgettable.\nBut, I canÃ‚Â´t see the point on spending so much money.\nI have been a kid of the ""old school"". When I was a child there was no option, the maximum you could get from your parents was a party at home with your 3 or 4 best friends, eat losts of sweets and when geting older even a pijama party!.\nIn conclusion I stick to the point of less is more also in this discussion.

What will be the effect on society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nNowadays, there are many courses available to take, from arts that include theatre and music to scientific topics such as mathemathics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.\nThere are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.\nThe importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.\nDiscussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and effectively addresses both the causes and effects of the issue.

However, a lot of countries have not enough students to take part in this subject. I think that the root of this issue are money and political problems. Also, the insufficient development of science will cause some social problems.\nFirst, to develop science, huge amount of money are required. It is necessary to establish certified facilities to provide a suitable environment for studying science and starting research. These facilities need to fulfil some international standards like ISO and IEEE which are not so easy to get, therefore the government might need to spend lots of money on building certified facilities. However, some countries dose not have such amount of money, so building certified facilities may be difficult for them to do. Second, some countries such as middle-east countries are suffering some political issues like civil war. it is difficult for them to develop science and to handle the war at the same time.\nScience influence many angles of our lives. First, life will be inconvenient. For example, people living in a poor country may not have cell phone. If there is emergency that needs to be informed immediately to others, it is difficult to find them. Second, internationally, the state of country may become low because of the low living standard of populace. Business will be influenced if the country dose not have great bargaining power. All the social issues will finally affect the financial stability and cause some sorrowful tragedies.\nIn summary, science is a key stone to develop a wealthy country.

333,182,"\nPrompt:\nIn many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?\n\nEssay: \nIn modern society, most people believe that money is as important and indispensable as water. As a result, in many countries, people talk more and more about money, such as how much they earn or pay for things in everyday conversation).\nThis phenomenon, I think is a negative development. And I have three reasons for this:\n1. Inner hypocrisy;\n2. Lack of confidence in oneself;\n3. Thinking and vision.\nFirst of all, the inner hypocrisy. Many young people like to talk to their friends about how much they earn and how many expensive things they buy. At the college reunion, everyone should introduce himself or herself. For example, what kind of work he or she is doing now; Recently bought a house and a car somewhere, and then has to recommend it to others. The core purpose is to say ""I\'ve made millions in just a few years and bought a house and a car."" Although they look nice on the outside, they are empty inside. Therefore, the inner hypocrisy is because they are empty in their heart and have nothing else to compare with others. They can use the money to make up for and satisfy their inner emptiness, and only in others can they find their sense of existence, recognition, and attention to themselves.\nSecondly, I am not confident in myself. Many elderly people like to chat about their children while playing cards under the community pavilion. For example: if your child is married; How much does your child earn in a month; Did your child buy you anything expensive? If you answer in the negative, you will be looked down upon, even saying, ""Your children are working such long hours for so little money and they don\'t buy you anything nice."" These people often talk about it because they are not confident in themselves and they know that their children are inferior in abilities and other aspects. In other words, they are uncertain and reckless. So they like to show off in front of each other and want to prove themselves and their ability to each other.\nFinally, the thinking and vision are not high. Every country or place has different classes of people, such as those living in rural China and; Paternal (they all lived in the past); on the surface look good in every way, but only after material things. Because they think money is the most important, money can do a lot of things, and only money can give them a sense of security. As can be seen from this, a person\'s circle of friends and living environment can determine a person\'s thinking and vision, so, only if your surroundings are positive, can attract more positive people like you.\nIn a word, if a person always talks about money, it shows that he is hypocritical inside, not confident in himself, thinking and vision are not high. So. Be sure to constantly improve your thinking and vision, constantly improve your ability in all aspects, and even keep positive at all times, so that not only can attract more people like you, but also your future life will be better.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Essay evaluation:\n\nTask Achievement:\n- The essay addresses the prompt by discussing why people in many countries talk about money and whether it is a positive or negative development.

A completed bachelor\'s degree course may cost over 10 thousand dollars. However, some grassroots families are hard to afford it. So they may tend to not study at universities but find a job for earning money. After that, college may lose some potentially intelligent students. Therefore, if this scheme can be implemented successfully, those students will show their ingenuity and get higher academic achievement, finally giving back to society when they succeed.\nOn the other hand, this scheme is not suitable for everyone. qualification checking is needed for choosing someone who truly aspires to an opportunity to study at college. For example, setting a line indicating the limit of the monthly income of a family is a way for the government to distinguish who is needed to help. Because the cost of the study is also a type of ""inspiration"" for students studying harder. If a family was proven to be able to afford the fees, the government would not give assistance to them in order to avoid abusive use.\nIn summary, although this scheme is advantageous for low-income families, revealing their children\'s inherent power, the government can set some rules for filtering those who are necessary for help.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay deserves a band 7.0 based on the following criteria:\n\n1.

Decades ago, individuals willingly invested considerable time and energy in reading and studying the works of authors such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. Literature clubs were popular and constantly filled with avid Shakespeare enthusiasts, many of whom were experts in the field. Unfortunately, in recent times, bookstores no longer prioritize the complete works of Dickens as they do not yield significant profits. Additionally, many literature clubs have closed down due to a significant decrease in membership.\n\nMoreover, it is evident that sports have also lost popularity. For example, just five years ago, there were many dedicated football fans, and almost every football club had a substantial number of loyal supporters. People were excited to anticipate match results and eagerly purchased match tickets and lotteries. However, this is no longer the case. People are now reluctant to spend two hours in a stadium watching a football match, as evidenced by the consistently empty stadiums.\n\nThese phenomena will have several negative effects on both individuals and society as a whole.

This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.\r\nFirstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They canÃ¢\x80\x99t speak well foreign language, canÃ¢\x80\x99t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they canÃ¢\x80\x99t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.\r\nOn the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.\r\nAt the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students.

352,305,"\r\nPrompt:\r\nSome people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nChampions have been heralded across cultures and religions for centuries. Hercules from Greek mythology and Samson from the Bible were known for their strength. Hermes, the messenger of the Greek gods adorned winged sandals to grant him the speed of wind. From ancient to current times, champions have shared their skills via sports. But a question has arisen. What takes presedence, brain or brawn?\r\nFor those who believe that physical strength is important for success in sport, we must consider the effort put into performing said activities. Running a marathon is easier said than done! Raising over 500kg above your head doesn't happen overnight, or rowing in appealing synchronization without training. Athletes train in gyms for countless hours by running on treadmills, strength training and doing plyometrics to develop the power in order to effectively perform their respective sports, thus proving the importance of physical strength to prevail in sports.\r\nOthers believe that in order to distinguish between the average and the greats, mental strength is the factor that does so. The amount of discipline, perserverance and other psychological strengths allow athletes to set world records. Former world's strong man, Eddie Hall has stated that he had used techniques from psychologists to unlock parts of the brain that provide super strength similar to that people use in life threatening situations to lift cars to save their children. He was able to become the first man to deadlift over 500kg. Though not as extreme, sportsmen and women must apply some form of mental strength to push themselves to achieve record-level excellence in sports.\r\nI believe that brain and brawn harmoniously work together to create exceptional champions in sports. Physical strength is the baseline that allows athletes to perform their skills with endurance, and mental strength is the value needed to push them to go one step ahead of their competition. Sportmen must be able to run, lift, or even row without issue, as well as try, try, and try again, working through limiting beliefs so that they can become apart of sporting history.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Revised Essay:\n\nChampions have been celebrated throughout history, across different cultures and religions. From the mighty Hercules of Greek mythology to the legendary Samson from the Bible, physical strength has always been admired. Even Hermes, the Greek god of messengers, relied on his winged sandals to grant him the speed of the wind. Throughout ancient and modern times, sports have been a platform for showcasing exceptional skills. However, a question arises: which is more crucial for success in sports, physical strength or mental strength?\n\nThose who advocate for the importance of physical strength argue that the effort required to excel in sports cannot be underestimated. Running a marathon, lifting over 500kg, or rowing in perfect synchronization all require extensive training. Athletes spend countless hours in gyms, engaging in activities such as running on treadmills, strength training, and plyometrics to develop the power necessary for their respective sports. This clearly demonstrates the significance of physical strength in achieving success in sports.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of mental strength contend that it is the differentiating factor between average athletes and exceptional ones. Discipline, perseverance, and other psychological attributes enable athletes to set world records. Eddie Hall, a former world's strongest man, revealed that he utilized techniques from psychologists to unlock parts of his brain that provided him with superhuman strength, similar to that displayed in life-threatening situations when individuals lift cars to save their loved ones. Although not as extreme, athletes must possess some degree of mental strength to surpass their own limits and achieve record-breaking performances in sports.\n\nIn my opinion, both physical strength and mental strength are vital for creating exceptional champions in sports. Physical strength acts as the foundation, enabling athletes to perform their skills with endurance. However, mental strength is the driving force propelling athletes to surpass their competition. Sportsmen and women must possess the ability to run, lift, or row effortlessly, while also demonstrating resilience and determination in the face of challenges. This combination of brain and brawn allows athletes to push themselves beyond what they thought was possible and etch their names in sporting history.\n\nIn conclusion, physical strength and mental strength are two interconnected aspects that contribute to success in sports. Physical strength provides the necessary foundation for athletes to excel, while mental strength enables them to surpass their own limitations and achieve exceptional performances. Therefore, both brain and brawn are essential for creating outstanding champions in the world of sports.""}]

It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.\r\nHowever, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.\r\nTo conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us.

In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and present my own opinion.\n\nOn one hand, research suggests that negative experiences children encounter before beginning school, particularly within their families, can have a profound and lasting impact. For instance, children raised by strict parents who employ harsh punishments for minor transgressions may develop aggressive tendencies and feel a lack of love and support from their families. This viewpoint seems reasonable, given the significant role that family plays in shaping a child's social development.\n\nOn the other hand, some argue that even if children receive gentle and nurturing treatment within their families, their experiences as teenagers, especially in school, can be equally influential. Adolescents spend more time at school than at home, with increased classroom learning and more opportunities for group work and socialization. Consequently, teenagers' peers and teachers can have a significant impact on their development. If teenagers form close relationships with positive influences, such as classmates who refrain from smoking or drinking alcohol or friends who engage in educational activities outside of school, parents can be assured that their child will mature into a well-rounded adult.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that children are primarily influenced by their families before starting school.

In this essay, I will count possible advantages as well as some disadvantages of such a change in life, in order to conclude whether or not it is a cost effective notion.\r\nIt is commonly believed that the enviroment has been endangered by imminent risks. Some people speculate that humans have been less connected to nature and therefore are not aware of the detrimental effects of their activities on the environment.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\r\n\r\nEssay: \r\nSome individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.\r\nActive development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.\r\nThe next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.\r\nOf course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it. To sum up, children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less.\r\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Revised Essay:\n\nSome individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development than playing computer games. I strongly agree that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.\n\nOne of the main reasons for including outdoor activities in children's lives is active development. It is widely known that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building their personality. Parents should strive to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals, or playing different games such as football and riding bicycles. These activities not only expand children's knowledge but also have a positive effect on their overall development. Additionally, promoting outdoor activities is important for cultivating a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or encourage them to socialize with friends, fostering social skills. For example, a father can teach his son how to ride a bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees, engaging in meaningful and educational activities together.\n\nAnother significant reason for prioritizing outdoor activities for children is the prevention of physical health problems that can arise from excessive computer game usage. In the present era, a significant number of people, including children, suffer from various side effects of a sedentary lifestyle, and obesity is a prime example. To counteract potential physical health problems in the future, it is advisable for all children to spend a couple of hours engaging in outdoor activities.\n\nWhile there is no harm in allowing children to spend some time playing computer games, it is crucial to limit their usage.

Humans in the world, in the present day do many paramount activities which are breathtaking, changing from hang-gliding to mountain climibing. In my opinion I think this is a good change for peoples lifes, under two considerable reasons, such as people get more life experiences in nature and for their physical fitness. In this essay I will ounline my opinion and provide reasons with valid examples.\r\nOn the one hand, human begins are under the pressure of globalisation, which leads them to get more trendy experiences from nature. Since younger generation is working towards the urban development of the world they are living in large cities full of pollution and high rising buildings. When ever they find enough spare time youngsters are trying to enjoy their lifes by climbing mountains which is hiking from the technical term. To contrast this gives them the opportunity to learn more about the outside world of cities, get more experience in mother nature. They develop their knowledge about the surroundings, such as the animals, birds and different flora and faunas. As an example one of my friends wanted to do the activity of flying which this is an human made activity, but after few findings through the internet and she seeing pictures how people enjoy hiking she decided to go on a trip to Mount Everest for climbing.\r\nOn the other hand, people, or the young generation have the sense that activity of flying apparatus are outdated and this is not providing then enough physical fitness to burn their calories. Due to these reasons some group of young as well as old people climb mountains to develop their well-being, mostly people such as athletes and humans who are having various diseases such as obesity, adore to do hiking.\r\nTo sum up, in my opinion this trend is not a bad idea for the poeple to get escaped from their busy lifestyles to enjoy the nature as well as develop their fitness rather than going to artificial equipment based buildings. In fact, every sport has their own risk, so people need to accept and beware of these risky issues and attend these activities.\r\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay shows some weaknesses in terms of grammar, vocabulary, cohesion, and coherence.

358,415,"\nPrompt:\nThe movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nNowadays population of the cities have grown bigger than in the countryside. I will write about my thought of the cause of the movement from the countryside into the cities, and if there is a possibility to reverse this event, what it will be.\nFirst, I think the cause of the movement is partly because of the difference of the convenience, and the work types you can get between in the countrysides, and in the cities. Personally I do prefer to live in the countrysides, but I can't bare if there are none or slow internet connections there. Also I think the varieties of the jobs you can get are quite different in each location. For example, when I went to Australia to get jobs, of course people tend to stay in the cities so that they can get easy, fancy city jobs like waiter/waitress, shop retail, jobs related with news papers and so on. However the number of jobs are limited. I really wanted to stay in the city, but the amount of money you get was not quite enough to pay rent, and holiday fee, so I moved into the countrysides which had varieties of farm jobs. Sure there were easy jobs like in the cities, but the number of shops, and restaurants are quite small, and they were hiring mostly local people rather than working holiday workers. There I got a farm hand job in the tomato field. It was really hard job. We needed to work from 7 am when the sun rises to 6 pm when the sun sets. It was hard for my poor body, too. That is why I think most people move to the cities rather than stay in the countrysides.\nAlthough I am not sure if there is a possibility to reverse this event, I think there are quite a lot of good experience you can only get in the countrysides. One thing I can say is the people and the living pace are slower, and more relaxed in countrysides than in the cities. For example like I myself said, I prefer living in the countrysides than in the cities. In fact I moved to Edmonton in Canada, which is a city, but I'd say more like a town, but a lot more relaxed than Tokyo where I used to live. Sometimes people living in the crazy fast cities like Tokyo, New York, and etc actually want to slow down the pace to more relaxing cities, or countrysides. If we want to reverse this movement, I think you need to advertise what benefits you can get in the countrysides. For example, they have quite magnificent views, good benefits to raise your kids, and so on. I think it can really reverse the movement because nowadays people are so interested in the educations of their kids, so scientifically we need to prove that living in the countrysides, and raising the children can be really beneficial for them. I myself have 2 children, and I can feel the benefits of living in the countrysides. The more free time they have, the more creative they become, and I strongly believe the more creative they are, the more happier they can lead their lives.\nAs a result, I believe that we can reverse, or slow down the speed of the movement of the people from the countrysides into the cities if we empharsise the benefits of raising kids in the countrysides more.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates some strengths in terms of its organization and coherence.

359,436,"\nPrompt:\nSome people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nEssay: \nThere is an opinion which is that the longer prison sentences is the best solution to reduce crime. On the contrary, some people say that there are better solutions to solve this problem. Overall, I totally agree with the latter opinion because I think that giving long prison sentences can not directly reduce crime.\nFirstly, I observe the advantage about giving longer prison sentences. Surely, people may hesitate to commit crime by strict sentences. Even if they would commit crime, they would have to be in prison for long days. In addition, living in prison for a long time may give a time to reflect themselvs for them.\nHowever, if crimers would be in the prison for a long time, it might be difficult for them to make them living on themselves because they might not be used to the social reality. It may cause them to commit crime again.\nIn addition to this, I think the poverty and a lot of burdens which people have may cause to commit crime. Because of two reasons, I think that countries have to propose policies which can stimulate economy and relieve their anxieties. Recently, many countries have experienced a recession. It cause the increasing the unemployment rate, so a lot of people suffer from hunger because of the povery. It will be supposed to cause them commit crime such as robbing. Then, people have many burdens because of woriking, raising their children and caring their parens. They have a lot of stress, so even if they could not reduce their stress, they might commit crime to reduce their mental pain. They may want a relax time.\nI think the latter opinion is more valid than the former by these reasons. These are my opinion about this problem.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay addresses the prompt and presents both views on the issue of reducing crime through longer prison sentences.

Similarly, the discussion on better solutions is limited to proposing policies to stimulate the economy and relieve anxieties. The essay should expand on these points and provide specific examples or evidence to support the arguments. \n\n2. Coherence and Cohesion: The essay lacks clear organization and logical progression of ideas. The second paragraph jumps from the advantages of longer prison sentences to the difficulties prisoners may face when reintegrating into society. It would be more effective to dedicate a separate paragraph to discussing the potential challenges faced by ex-convicts.

But is it true that it is now more important in terms of sail rates, than the goods themselves and the actual requests of the society?\nFirst of all, I think that usually in the one selected price range, all the products serving the same purpose have more or less equal properties such as quality or taste. This is indeed true, for example, for many electronic devices which are are produced by the nearby factories somewhere in China regardless the brand, and therefore their sales depend more on marketing strategies.\nHowever, if the one buys the goods of well known brand, he trusts the experience beneath this brand. This is a kind of assurance that a consumer gets excactly what he expects and that a product is not defective. For instance, when choosing the car, you probably would firstly consider BMW or Mercedec. The reason why you know them is not only good advertising, but also quality proved by millions of clients throughout the years.\nMoreover, I believe that modern society actually moves towards the conscious consumption. This implies people becoming more and more awared of product and its manufactoring process ratheer than advertising.

However, some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as 'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. The upcoming essay will discuss why I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised.\nFirstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. These days, people do not see the meaning behind the painting or the message the artist is trying to convey rather they buy those paintings which are popular and contemporary. To illustrate it further, in art auctions it can be seen that when one person bids on one painting, no matter whether it is good or bad, others also start putting their money on it. Thus it is clear that normal art forms are winning prizes due to public attention.\nSecondly, some artists might bribe the organizers of exhibitions to promote their canvas. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances when artists were caught while signing up deals to increase the sales of their work. If a certain artwork receives publicity then it is impossible that it would not have an influence on the public. This type of promotion skews a person's opinion about a certain picture and so are forced to think about purchasing it, leaving behind original ones. Therefore, it is apparent that the diabolical activities of painters are responsible for their works being labelled as masterpieces.\nTo conclude, the maintenance of social position and influence of painters are the prime causes for the popularity of ordinary artworks and the negligence of true works. Hence I agree with the given statement.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of language and effectively addresses the prompt.

Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?\nIf the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.\nThe question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?\nThe older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.\nThe ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.\nLet's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.\nWhat if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?\nI am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.\nI would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.\nOf course, this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach.\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Revised Essay:\n\nMany argue that due to the increased life expectancy, the retirement age should be significantly raised. I partially disagree with this viewpoint. Rather than solely considering life expectancy, the nature of the job and the physical and mental ability of the individual should be taken into account.\n\nWhile it is true that people are living longer due to advances in medicine and the healthcare industry, it is unfair to assume that everyone should continue working until a later age. The nature of the job should be the determining factor. If a job is physically demanding and exhausting, it would be more beneficial for individuals to retire at an earlier age. For instance, if someone is constantly worn out due to the strenuous nature of their work, their life expectancy should not dictate their right to retire.\n\nAdditionally, it is essential to consider the person's physical and mental capabilities. As people age, their reaction time tends to slow down. This is particularly crucial in jobs that require quick responses to potential dangers. For example, in a construction site, an elderly carpenter may not be able to react as swiftly as a younger worker if a wall were to collapse. In such scenarios, it is reasonable to prioritize the safety of workers and consider the capabilities of individuals while determining the retirement age.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is important to acknowledge the increased life expectancy, it should not be the sole factor in determining the retirement age. The physical demands of the job and the abilities of the individual to cope with the work should also be taken into consideration.

I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.\nTo begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.\nAnother reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners.

However, there are both advantages and disadvantages to this method of shopping.\n\nOne of the main advantages of online shopping is the convenience it offers. It allows individuals to save time and energy by easily browsing and purchasing products from the comfort of their own homes. With just a click of a button, people can have their desired items delivered directly to their doorstep. This convenience is particularly beneficial for those who have busy schedules and cannot find the time to visit physical stores.\n\nHowever, there are several disadvantages to online shopping as well. One common issue is order delays, where the delivery takes longer than expected. This can be frustrating, especially when individuals are eagerly awaiting their purchases. Additionally, there is a risk of receiving the wrong items or incorrect orders. Sometimes, individuals may find that what they receive is completely different from what they had ordered. This can be attributed to false advertising or mistakes made during the packaging and shipping process. Furthermore, individuals may be disappointed with the quality of the product received, especially if it does not match the description or images presented on the website.\n\nIn my opinion, if one decides to shop online, it is crucial to carefully choose a reputable and trustworthy website. Before making a purchase, it is essential to research the website's reputation and read reviews from other customers. This will help ensure a safe and secure online shopping experience. On the other hand, shopping at physical department stores offers a more comfortable and secure experience, as individuals have the opportunity to physically examine the products before making a purchase.\n\nIn conclusion, online shopping has both advantages and disadvantages. While it provides convenience and time-saving benefits, it also comes with the risk of order delays, wrong orders, and receiving products of lower quality than expected. It is important for individuals to assess the credibility of the online store before making a purchase.

In my opinion, this way of studing has both positive and negative aspects. This essay will argue why studing online can be unproductive for people.\nThe first reason why studing online is not good for a student is that is easier for him to lost the concentraiton during a lecture. For example, last year beacuse of the pandemic period, all students had to get class online, including me. It was a terrible year, because I stayed at home all the time and became very difficult listening lectures due to lot of things that capture my attention during lessons.\nThe other reason why getting class on the internet is a negative development is that the direct interaction between people is absent.

By contrast, the social life is important for everyone, because it help people to grow and share good and bad moment of the life.

For example, last year, due to the pandemic, all students had to attend classes online, including myself. It was a challenging year as I found it difficult to stay focused during lectures due to various distractions at home.\n\nAnother negative aspect of online learning is the absence of direct interaction between individuals. This lack of personal connection and social interaction can be considered the biggest drawback of online education.

I completely disagree and will state side of my view.\nThe reason why some people hold to this argument is because global warming is difficult to control. For example, there are no control measures on second hand cars bought in Botswana people end up buying old damaged cars. Consequently they end up emmiting smoke and have an impact to the climate. Other reason is, people they do not follow polices implemented by the government making it hard to prevent harm to climate. For instance, policy made in Botswana that people should get permits to cut trees but instead they do that without them. Above reasons are good enough to people to think that they\nshould find ways to live with global warming issues instead of preventing them.\nNethertheless, I beileve global warming can be preventable and cannot be accepted because it is harmful. It can damage our eco system. Reason being,people cutting treess will lead to less of them thus more carbon dioxide in the climate which is harmful to survival. Also it can lead to less rainfall being produced, resulting to less food being produced and no water. Therefore flora and fauna will suffer as well as human beings. Lastly due to climate change it can happen that the sun will burn plants in farms, that is less food produced then people will suffer. The government should put policies in place and make sure people abide by them to prevent global warming.\nTo conclude, though some people believe to find ways to survive with climate change I am against that as the damages caused by it are of more significance.

From my perspective, it is not true. I disagree with this statement because people can, indeed, learn significantly from previous human behaviours and nature patterns, as it often happens in cycles, in other words, it is repeated from time to time, so it proves that one day the knowledge gained might be useful in the future. Additionally, many discoveries and pieces of research, that were made in the past, applies to the present time.\nAt first, it has been proved by many geologists that, despite the global warming, the weather follow a cycle pattern. This way, it is possible to predict the future challenges that the humankind will likely face, such as seasons of extremely low or high temperatures. Moreover, the same trend applies to the human behaviours. It is known that some situations will probably be repeated, such as wars and economic crisis, and this is considered part of humans' evolution. Therefore, knowing that many aspects will likely happen, in a similar way, in the future, proves that the knowledge about the past is relevant.\nBesides that, it is valid to state that many discoveries from earlier ages, such as the medicines and the technology advance, are vital for nowadays life. People should not take them for granted, as most of the things that the global population has achieved, once, depended on the previous researches.\nIn conclusion, individuals should, indeed, learn from the past.

In my opinion, there is much to be learned from past human behaviors and natural patterns, as they often occur in cycles and may prove useful in the future. Additionally, many discoveries and research made in the past continue to have relevance in the present.\n\nTo begin with, geologists have demonstrated that despite global warming, weather patterns follow a cyclic pattern. This allows us to predict future challenges, such as seasons of extreme temperatures. Similarly, human behaviors often repeat themselves. History has shown us that events like wars and economic crises are part of our evolution and are likely to occur again.

Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nRecently, there have been significant changes in the family structure and family roles. This essay will illuminate some of these changes and analyse whether such changes are beneficial or detrimental.\nOne of the most prominent changes in this regard refers to the tendency of couples having fewer children or even no children, which may be attributed to adults' increasing workload and ensuing inability to look after children properly. Given their hectic schedules and rational concerns about their limited time and patience in taking care of adolescents, many couples would rather have fewer children. Another change is the growing trend of females joining the workforce, as necessitated by increasing living expenses, such as utility bills and property prices. To afford such costs and reach expected living standards, females have to give up being family women and apply for jobs. The other factor driving women to take jobs is the popularity of feminism upholding that women should be equal to men in all aspects, including employment.\nAs far as I am concerned, these changes derive from people's practical and merticulous considerations in the face of huge challenges, namely, the lack of time to take care of minors and soaring living costs. To tackles these obstacles, it is necessary for people to make such changes. Therefore, I vehemently support these changes.\nTo sum up, the modern society is witnessing great changes in the family structure and family roles, as exemplified by the smaller family size and larger number of females taking jobs.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of living?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nHigh-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nIt indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of Ã¢\x80\x98street salespeopleÃ¢\x80\x99, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in peopleÃ¢\x80\x99s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. Whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

377,667,"\nPrompt:\nSome people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable.Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.\n\nEssay: \nPunishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a childÃ¢\x80\x99s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Revised Essay:\n\nPunishing children with physical force, also known as corporal punishment, was once considered acceptable but is now against the law in most countries. This essay explores the use of physical force to discipline children, presenting arguments from both sides, before delivering a personal opinion.\n\nSupporters of corporal punishment argue that it can be effective when used moderately. They emphasize that it does not entail severe beatings resulting in bruises or cuts. Instead, they contend that mild pain and the fear of its application can instill discipline. Individuals who grew up with corporal punishment may support this perspective.\n\nOpponents of physical force on children, however, assert that their vulnerability and innocence warrant protection. They argue that children should trust adults and feel safe, believing that no harm will be inflicted upon them. Additionally, opponents claim that corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a solution to problems. They assert that other forms of discipline exist that do not require physical force and are equally effective. Moreover, they argue that corporal punishment can cause psychological harm and should be regarded as child abuse.\n\nPersonally, I do not believe that limited use of corporal punishment causes harm, and I do not advocate for criminal proceedings against parents who administer mild forms of it. However, I would not employ physical force as a means of disciplining children myself. I also acknowledge the potential for misuse by individuals who are not the child's parents. Therefore, I believe that, overall, physical force to discipline children should not be allowed.\n\nIn conclusion, corporal punishment has become increasingly unacceptable in today's society, with many countries outlawing its use. While some argue that it can be effective when used moderately, opponents stress the need to protect children and promote alternative forms of discipline. Personally, I do not endorse physical force as a means of disciplining children, but I understand different perspectives and the potential for misuse.""}]

They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parentsÃ¢\x80\x99 home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also donÃ¢\x80\x99t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generationÃ¢\x80\x99s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong command of the English language and effectively addresses the prompt.

Others believe it isnÃ¢\x80\x99t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isnÃ¢\x80\x99t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. WhatÃ¢\x80\x99s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. In my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Overall, this essay deserves a band 8.0 based on the following criteria:\n\n1.

Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion.

Of course, theory is very , however, you canÃ¢\x80\x99t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they arenÃ¢\x80\x99t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students canÃ¢\x80\x99t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group AÃ¢\x80\x99s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university.

Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers.

In my opinion, I consider child labor to be completely wrong as it infringes upon their rights to live and study in peaceful conditions.\n\nFirstly, it is important to acknowledge that children are not equipped to be workers. They are still in the process of discovering the world and lack any experience or understanding of work. Due to their innocence and vulnerability, they are easily taken advantage of and exploited.

Their primary responsibility lies in learning and education. They are not mature enough to comprehend the significance of work experience. However, they can contribute to their families by assisting with chores or household tasks. This would be a more suitable way for them to develop a sense of responsibility.

387,752,"\nPrompt:\nShould wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens?\n\nEssay: \nI think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, without compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a .Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are poor. Famine, diseases, crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. , many nations in Europe and America are rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future.Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nationsÃ¢\x80\x99. This canÃ¢\x80\x99t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we have to do is its bad side and its good side.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Revised Essay: \nIn today's globalized world, the issue of whether wealthy nations should be obligated to share their wealth with poorer nations is a highly debated topic. While some argue that it is the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens, I firmly believe that affluent nations should be required to provide aid in the form of food and education. This essay will outline three reasons why wealthy nations should share their wealth with poorer nations, considering the humanitarian aspect, the potential consequences of inequality, and the need for limited aid.\n\nFirstly, it is our moral duty as human beings to show compassion and empathy towards those who are less fortunate. Regardless of nationality or socioeconomic status, every individual deserves access to basic necessities such as food and education. By providing aid to poorer nations, wealthy countries can fulfill their obligations as members of the global community and contribute to the well-being of humanity as a whole.\n\nSecondly, the wide disparity in wealth between developed and developing nations poses a significant threat to global stability. Neglecting the needs of poorer nations can lead to a perpetual cycle of poverty, which may result in social unrest, political instability, and increased migration. By sharing their wealth, affluent nations can help alleviate these issues and promote a more equitable distribution of resources. This not only benefits the poorer nations but also ensures a more stable and secure world for everyone.\n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that aid should have limitations. Providing support in the form of food, medicine, and education is essential, but it should be done in a way that encourages self-sufficiency and sustainable development. Excessive reliance on external assistance can hinder the growth and progress of poorer nations, as it may discourage them from taking responsibility for their own development. Furthermore, wealthy nations must ensure that their aid does not come with any ulterior motives or attempts to influence the governance of the recipient countries.\n\nIn conclusion, wealthy nations have a responsibility to share their wealth with poorer nations for several reasons. By doing so, they can fulfill their moral obligations, address global inequality, and promote stability. However, it is crucial to strike a balance between providing aid and empowering poorer nations to take charge of their own development. With careful consideration and strategic implementation, sharing wealth can have a positive and transformative impact on the world.""}]

399,64,"\nPrompt:\nWrite about the following topic.With the improvements in todayÃ¢\x80\x99s health care, society has to care for more and more elderly people.Do you feel that society will be able to cope with the increase in numbers of elderly people today and how can it be managed?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nIn our modern society and the development and improvement of health care sector, the average expected life age has increased comparing to what it was like in the past. This as good as it is, aslo raised the cncern of tkaing care of elderly people. In my opinion, I believe that the ability to deal with this concern depends on two main factors, which are the degree of country developement as well as the society characteristics.\nFirst of all, to be able to take care of elderly people, the relevant orginizations and innstitutions should be in place. However, this condition most of the time cannot be found in under-developed countires. That is because of the lack of funding resources. On the other hand, more developed countries, such as The Netherlands, Norway, and other european countires, are more capable of taking care of elderly. That is because they have the enough resources to fund such non-profitable orginizations.\nNevertheless, other factor that must be taken into account, is the society characteristcs. Here we mean, wheather the society is considered individualist or socialist. In social societies, countries do not need to allocate a lot of resources on elderly care, because this role is already taken by families. Where in individualist societies, most of the times elder people will be living alone. Therefore, when they reach the point where they cannot take care of themselves, they will go to elderly care houses.\nTo summarize, the ability to taking care of elderly people depends on two main factors, the country developement and the society type. If the country is developed or the society is considered social, taking care of the mental and physical health of elderly people will be eaiser. In contrast, if the country institutions are under-developed or the society is considered individualist, taking care of eldery people will be much harder.\n',"," 'evalutation': ""Revised Essay:\n\nIn our modern society, advancements in healthcare have led to an increase in the average life expectancy compared to the past. This positive development has also raised concerns about how to care for the growing elderly population. In my opinion, the ability to address this concern depends on two main factors: the country's level of development and the characteristics of its society.\n\nFirstly, the presence of relevant organizations and institutions is crucial in providing care for elderly people. However, this condition is often lacking in underdeveloped countries due to a lack of funding resources. On the other hand, more developed countries such as The Netherlands, Norway, and other European countries are better equipped to take care of the elderly because they have sufficient resources to fund non-profit organizations dedicated to this cause.\n\nMoreover, the characteristics of society also play a significant role. Specifically, whether a society is individualistic or socialist impacts its approach to elderly care. In social societies, the responsibility of caring for the elderly is often assumed by families, which reduces the need for extensive resources allocated to elderly care. In contrast, individualistic societies often have a higher number of elderly people living alone. When these individuals reach a point where they can no longer care for themselves, they rely on elderly care centers or nursing homes.\n\nIn conclusion, the ability to provide adequate care for elderly people depends on two key factors: the level of development in a country and the societal values it holds. Developed countries or societies with a more collective approach to caring for the elderly are better equipped to manage the physical and mental health needs of this population. Conversely, underdeveloped countries or individualistic societies face greater challenges in providing care for the elderly. Overall, the ability to cope with the increasing number of elderly people depends on the specific context in which they are situated. \n\nRe-evaluation according to IELTS Writing criteria:\n\n1.

According to some, it should be better to separate students based on their academic skills, while others believe that a valid education can be transmitted without discriminating people based on their ability.\nPeople that support the separation of students believe that an omogeneous group can learn better and faster. Indeed, if someone has less skills compared to the others component of the group, teachers have two possibilities. First, to lower the level of the lessons in order to allow a catch up. Second, leave behind the student wiht low ability. Both solutions are not optimals. Thus, if we put together students with similar capabilities, we can make the process of learing more efficent for both groups.\nThe other vision is to educate students all together. By doing so, you can encourage low skills students to engage theirselves to catch up with the most brilliant one. Moreover, if you split the group, students with less capabilities can develop self-estimation problems and so, they will think that they can not be in the ""best"" group. Another good point for educate all students together is that people with higher ability will help their classmates. However, the level of the class will be probably lower.\nTo conclude, I think that the best solution depends on the purpose of the educator and on the age of students.

While some argue that dividing students can provide tailored support and boost their learning, others believe that educating students together promotes inclusivity and peer learning. In my opinion, students should be divided according to their academic abilities, as this approach allows for targeted support and encourages self-confidence.\n\nDividing students based on their academic ability can cater to their specific learning needs. For instance, students who require extra support can benefit from smaller class sizes and personalized attention from teachers. This individualized approach not only enhances their understanding of the subjects but also boosts their confidence. By receiving additional help, these students are more likely to believe in their own capabilities and grasp the information required by their subjects.\n\nHowever, there are drawbacks to segregating students based on their academic ability. One major concern is that it can lead to feelings of boredom and isolation among the less academically advanced students. They may miss out on the opportunity to interact with their peers, which is essential for social development. Additionally, being placed in a lower academic track can demotivate students and result in poor grades. It is important to strike a balance between division based on ability and maintaining a sense of belonging and inclusivity.\n\nOn the other hand, educating students together can foster a sense of belonging and encourage peer learning. Collaborating with classmates can help students gain different perspectives and deepen their understanding of the subject matter. By learning from their peers, students can develop important social and communication skills, which are highly beneficial in the real world.\n\nHowever, there are challenges associated with educating students together. The presence of distractions from peers can hinder students' focus and overall academic performance. Furthermore, without tailored support, students with different academic abilities may struggle to keep up with the pace of the class. This can lead to gaps in their understanding and hinder their overall learning progress.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments for both dividing students based on their academic ability and educating them together, I believe that division according to ability is more beneficial. It allows for targeted support and enhances students' self-confidence. However, it is crucial to ensure that students in different tracks still have opportunities for social interaction and support. Ultimately, students should be mature enough to handle their academic placement and strive to excel with the additional help provided.""}]

Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nThe topic of gay marriage merely failed to be discussed. However, when it comes to whether gay marriage should be allowed legally, individuals hold divergent views. As far as I am concerned, the government should treat gay marriage as a legal thing.\nUndoubtedly, gay marriage can be beneficial. First of all, it is able to shrink the disparity between the affluent and the impoverished. For instance, some countries which allow gay marriage legally have become well-known tourism sites now by attracting foreign gays to come. Thus, their tourism industry can be thrived and the moribund local economy can be turned into the resurgent one, which may help to avoid turning the gap into gulf. Additionally, allowing gay marriage to be legal is also able to undermine the crime rate. On condition that some gays cannot enjoy the right of marriage, they may feel underrated, underprivileged and underappreciated, which may give them the predisposition to revenge the society to express their resentment and dissatisfaction. What is more, the government is able to diminish cultural conflict through making gay marriage a law. Provided that some individuals get little acquainted with gay culture, they may deem it as aggressive. However, by admitting it as a low, we can minimize such vulnerability and promote the mutual understanding of divergent cultures.\nOn the other hand, treating gay marriage legally also has various disadvantages. Firstly, it may undermine family rapport for the reason that some family members may not willing to accept gay marriage, which may cause the increasingly indifferent among family members and finally lead to family skirmish and splintering. In addition, some young individuals are possible to make mistakes at an early age if the government makes gay marriage law. It is widely acknowledged that some young people are not mature enough to choose the right partner. Provided that they get married at an early age, they may suffer irreversible loss.\nTo sum up, although there are some disadvantages to let gay marriage be legal, the benefits of it are multifaceted. Considering the development of the economy and culture, I agree with allowing gay marriage to be a legal option.\n',"," 'evalutation': 'Revised Essay:\n\nThe topic of gay marriage is a highly debated issue. People have different opinions on whether gay marriage should be legally allowed. In my opinion, the government should recognize gay marriage as a legal institution.\n\nGay marriage can have several benefits. Firstly, it can help reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. For example, countries that have legalized gay marriage have seen an increase in tourism from foreign gay couples. This boosts the local economy and helps bridge the economic divide. Furthermore, legalizing gay marriage can also help reduce crime rates. When some individuals are denied the right to marry, they may feel marginalized and resentful towards society. This can lead to acts of revenge or dissatisfaction. By granting them the right to marry, the government can promote inclusivity and reduce potential conflicts.\n\nHowever, legalizing gay marriage also has its drawbacks. It can negatively impact family relationships, as some family members may not accept gay marriage. This can lead to strained and fractured family dynamics. Additionally, young individuals may make hasty decisions if gay marriage becomes legal. It is widely acknowledged that young people may not have the maturity to choose the right partner at an early age. This could result in irreversible consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are disadvantages to legalizing gay marriage, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

Some people say that this is due to money, however, I strongly oppose that money has the hugest impact on this choice in modern society. I feel this way for 2 reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.\nTo begin with, working is considered one of the crucial factors to fulfill people's life. Specifically, most people would be satisfied when they are helpful to others through their work. Besides, these experiences would easily contribute them to further hard work. Above all, human beings originally like being appreciated by someone. To be more specific, I like my job because I can feel self-confident through my work. It is manifest that money is not only the vital motivation for working in this regard.\nSome augments can be made that social status gained through the success of their business must be crucial enough to direct people to work. The main reason for this is that experiences of success would bring excitement and happiness to them. They also could feel superior to others. Close examination would reveal that people with high social status could have tons of options compared with common people. That is to say, it is completely evident that higher social status can become an important factor as money.\nHaving considered all the augments above, I would conclude that only money has the most influence on motivation for business. There must be other vital factors present such as social statius and rewarding/\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Revised Essay:\n\nIn today's society, many individuals prioritize their careers over their personal lives. While some argue that money is the primary motivator for staying in the workforce, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, there are other significant factors that influence this decision. This essay will explore two reasons to support my stance.\n\nFirstly, work plays a crucial role in fulfilling people's lives. Many individuals derive satisfaction from being able to help others through their work. These experiences often serve as motivation for individuals to work harder and strive for success. Moreover, humans have an innate desire to be appreciated by others. Personally, I derive a sense of self-confidence from my job. This clearly indicates that money is not the sole driving force behind work motivation.\n\nAdditionally, the social status attained through professional success can be a compelling factor in motivating individuals to stay in the workforce. Achieving success brings a sense of excitement and happiness, making individuals feel superior to others. Furthermore, individuals with high social status have access to a wide range of opportunities that may not be available to the general public. Therefore, it is evident that social status can be just as influential as money in motivating individuals to remain in the workforce.\n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, it can be concluded that money is not the sole determinant of work motivation. Other significant factors, such as social status and personal fulfillment, also play a crucial role. Therefore, it is incorrect to claim that money is the most important factor in motivating individuals to stay in the workforce.""}]

405,121,"\nPrompt:\nWrite about the following topic.Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nEssay: \nThe public is rarely found agreeing on one opinion. One might take a simpe problem such as manufacturers responsible for excessive packaging, or customers should avoid buying such goods as example. Let me tackle this problem in brief.\nManufacturers and supermarkets may be noticed selling their goods excessivly packaged, and that may dissatisfy a portion of their customers. Those customers believe that such sellers should reduce such packaging. Looking into it, it sounds that sellers would also be responsible if their goods where damaged, which would lead to a decrease in income. It also does cost a little more to wrap goods securely to avoid damage, so while that may be a little inconvenient for manufacturers, it is necessary to avoid serious losses later on.\nCustomers have full right to avoid excessivly packaged goods, if it so contrasts their taste. They may feel it is tiresome to unwrap, or hard to get rid of all the mess it creates afterwords. They would think that is a manufacturer's task to unwrap the goods once they are available at the market, or even once the arrive at their houses if it is an online service. It would logically seem much convenient to them to have instant access to their product instead of all the unpackaging that preceeds the unboxing purchased goods.\nPersonally, I believe a little unwrapping isn't so invonvenient, and it doesn't have to fall on a manufacturer to unwrap his goods before selling. A little unpackaging might even be thrilling sometimes, to build up excitement before unboxing your awaited product. I'd add, with little offense meant, that people are getting a little lazy to do a simple task as unpackaging.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates some strengths in terms of language use and organization.

410,170,"\nPrompt:\nSome people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nEssay: \nThere are two possible ways to interprete the significance of history experience for our everyday life.\nThe first point is to ignore the history experience. The main reason is based on the opinion that history never repeats. All historical persons that lived at the elder times never made their decisions in the conditions those surround us. The world has changed significantly. Technology, information, transport, medicine, human rights - all these important parts of our life has changed since the elder times. So, we can not directly copy the decisions of different problems of the elder times to our present life.\nThe second point is to use the history experience in our present life. This opinion is based on observed samples of very similar intervals of history. At different time periods in different countries there were some events or historical processes being very similar. There are a lot of examples illustrating this thought. All countries of Medieval Europe and Asia past through the feodalism period. Then leaders of that counties decided that the feodalism is not the most effective way to control the country and annuled it. Nowadays we know that experience and, I believe, there will be no attempts to buld the feodalism again. The second example is the practice of conquestions. There were a lot of great conquerrors in the world's history: Alexander Macedonian, Caesar, Chinggis-khan, Napoleon, Gitler. All the listed persons conquerred big territories, their armies were very strong. But some time past and their empires were broken. Sometimes their enemies united against the conquerrors, sometimes they just died and their successors could not save the empires. But always the empires died. Nowadays we have no any signs of old borders of that empires. Actually all state borders are based on nations' borders, not on the old conquestions.\nI think the second opinion is better. The reason is following. There are a lot of institutions in our life that we like. For example, human rights, property rights, education, medicine. All these institutions appeared as a result of historical experince. If our predecessors ignored that experience, we would never live in the modern society. In that case we would have no modern medicine and education, also we would live in the society with slaver.

In recent years, there has been a global impoverishment due to factors such as inflation and geopolitical conflicts. Fluctuations in energy prices and the war between Russia and Ukraine have exacerbated inflation, leading to a rise in prices for basic commodities. However, salaries have not kept pace with inflation, leading to a loss of value for society.

This essay will give two possible reasons for this phenomenon and explain the negative impacts on society.\nTwo major causes keep people lingering on this topic. Firstly, the difficulties in earning a living in some countries have significantly drawn people's focus on finance. For instance, more job opportunities are needed for job seekers in countries with low productivity. Besides that, in many low-income countries, people have to endure low pay; in some extreme cases, their earnings can not cover their spending. Therefore, tremendous anxiety cause people from these countries constantly talk about their financial situations.\nOn the other side, flaunting is becoming the mainstream mindset in some countries. Commonly, in some countries that just escaped poverty, the increasing spared money makes showing off possible. People in these countries display their wealth by owning luxurious items, such as branded bags or jewelry. Therefore, money naturally becomes essential in their conversations.\nAlthough the reasons for money focusing vary, it might develop into risky societal factors. If the frequent discussion of finance is due to insufficient employment or inadequate wages, it is an alarm to the governments to carry on measures of boosting industries' development. Otherwise, riots might be expected and harm social safety. Furthermore, this widespread discussion highly leads to material comparison, which harms morality and even allows crimes to occur. When individuals obsess with showing off, they feel the shame of disposing of the downsides. To maintain a perfect image- especially a wealthy appearance, some people even turn to crime, such as stealing or robbery.\nTo conclude, folks popularly discuss money for various reasons, such as the demands of work or psychological factors.

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nEssay: \nIn recent years, in some countries, including Japan, some people believe that governments should cover all tuition fees for students who are willing to study at university. Although the total cost will be massive and the governments need to increase the tax on citizens, I strongly agree with this opinion.\nTo begin with, it is absolutely unfair for students who need to give up going to university because of a lack of money. In Japan, they need to terminate to pursue their study at university, there are many students who study diligently though. If the government supported them financially, those who terminated their study could have continued studying and had the great job opportunities they hoped for.\nIn addition, some developed countries have been suffering from depopulation so there are some industries, such as IT, and Civil engineering that chronically have a problem with how to improve the shortage of employees. If governments encourage students to study these industries at university for free, the companies will be not only helpful to increase the number of employees, and also effective for students to obtain some qualifications in advance in university. This\nmeans that the companies do not necessarily spare longer training time than usual for new employees.\nFurthermore, economic growth is linked inextricably with education. If all students could have a variety of courses at university for free charge, they will be able to obtain skillful techniques and plenty of knowledge to pursue their career opportunities regardless of age. In addition, they will be able to study with working at the same time with light-hearted such as nighttime courses, and weekend courses. If they could work and study flexibly, they will obtain more creative ideas to improve their work.

What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.\nIf we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.\nIn fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.\nThe opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.\nTo summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.\nEducation and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation.\n"","," 'evalutation': ""Revised Essay:\n\nThis essay agrees with the idea that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but it emphasizes that students should demonstrate their capability to excel in university studies. For instance, in Scandinavian countries, the government provides specific student loans with long loan terms and low interest rates, enabling a larger number of students to pursue higher education. Although these loans are not free, they still offer increased accessibility to university studies.\n\nMoreover, in many European countries, university fees are relatively affordable, allowing most students to enroll in bachelor's programs. However, the main challenge lies in meeting the qualifications required for admission into the desired university program. Therefore, while fees may not be a major obstacle, students must possess the necessary qualifications to access their preferred fields of study.\n\nGlobally, university studies are predominantly pursued by the wealthy population. Shockingly, recent statistics revealed that only 17% of the world's population holds a university degree. This disparity is particularly noticeable between developed and undeveloped countries. Developed nations, such as those in Europe, witness an excessive number of university students. Regrettably, these graduates often struggle to find suitable employment within their home countries, leading many to immigrate to other European nations or even countries outside Europe. Conversely, in underdeveloped countries, the high cost of university fees renders higher education inaccessible to the majority, resulting in a surplus of unemployed vocational workers who are compelled to seek employment abroad.\n\nIn conclusion, educational fees should not impede individuals from pursuing university studies. Instead, the primary obstacle should be the fulfillment of necessary qualifications. Education, along with healthcare, should be available to all citizens, irrespective of their socioeconomic backgrounds. By removing financial barriers, governments can ensure equal opportunities for all individuals to access higher education.""}]

If those student haven't enouth money or condition to pay all fees, states only need to provide a special credits to them.\n"","," 'evalutation': 'Overall, this essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the prompt and presents a clear stance.
